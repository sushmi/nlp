memory: but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel, making a famine where abundance lies, thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament, and only herald to the gaudy spring, within thine own bud buriest thy content, and, tender churl, makst waste in niggarding: pity the world, or else this glutton be, to eat the worlds due, by the grave and thee . when forty winters shall besiege thy brow, and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field, thy youths proud livery so gazed on now, will be a tattered weed of small worth held: then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, where all the treasure of thy lusty days; to say, within thine own deep sunken eyes, were an alleating shame, and thriftless praise . how much more praise deservd thy beautys use, if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine shall sum my count, and make my old excuse, proving his beauty by succession thine . this were to be new made when thou art old, and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold . look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, now is the time that face should form another, whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother . for where is she so fair whose uneared womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry ? or who is he so fond will be the tomb of his selflove to stop posterity ? thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime, so thou through windows of thine age shalt see, despite of wrinkles this thy golden time . but if thou live remembered not to be, die single and thine image dies with thee . unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend, upon thyself thy beautys legacy ? natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend, and being frank she lends to those are free: then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse, the bounteous largess given thee to give ? profitless usurer why dost thou use so great a sum of sums yet canst not live ? for having traffic with thyself alone, thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive, then how when nature calls thee to be gone, what acceptable audit canst thou leave ? thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, which used lives th executor to be . those hours that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell will play the tyrants to the very same, and that unfair which fairly doth excel: for neverresting time leads summer on to hideous winter and confounds him there, sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, beauty oersnowed and bareness every where: then were not summers distillation left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, beautys effect with beauty were bereft, nor it nor no remembrance what it was . but flowers distilled though they with winter meet, leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet . then let not winters ragged hand deface, in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled: make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place, with beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled: that use is not forbidden usury, which happies those that pay the willing loan; thats for thyself to breed another thee, or ten times happier be it ten for one, ten times thyself were happier than thou art, if ten of thine ten times refigured thee: then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, leaving thee living in posterity ? be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair, to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir . lo in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head, each under eye doth homage to his newappearing sight, serving with looks his sacred majesty, and having climbed the steepup heavenly hill, resembling strong youth in his middle age, yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, attending on his golden pilgrimage: but when from highmost pitch with weary car, like feeble age he reeleth from the day, the eyes fore duteous now converted are from his low tract and look another way: so thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon: unlooked on diest unless thou get a son . music to hear, why hearst thou music sadly ? sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly, or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy ? if the true concord of welltuned sounds, by unions married do offend thine ear, they do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear: mark how one string sweet husband to another, strikes each in each by mutual ordering; resembling sire, and child, and happy mother, who all in one, one pleasing note do sing: whose speechless song being many, seeming one, sings this to thee, thou single wilt prove none . is it for fear to wet a widows eye, that thou consumst thyself in single life ? ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die, the world will wail thee like a makeless wife, the world will be thy widow and still weep, that thou no form of thee hast left behind, when every private widow well may keep, by childrens eyes, her husbands shape in mind: look what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; but beautys waste hath in the world an end, and kept unused the user so destroys it: no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murdrous shame commits . for shame deny that thou bearst love to any who for thyself art so unprovident . grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, but that thou none lovst is most evident: for thou art so possessed with murdrous hate, that gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire, seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire: o change thy thought, that i may change my mind, shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love ? be as thy presence is gracious and kind, or to thyself at least kindhearted prove, make thee another self for love of me, that beauty still may live in thine or thee . as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst, in one of thine, from that which thou departest, and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst, thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest, herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase, without this folly, age, and cold decay, if all were minded so, the times should cease, and threescore year would make the world away: let those whom nature hath not made for store, harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish: look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more; which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish: she carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby, thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die . when i do count the clock that tells the time, and see the brave day sunk in hideous night, when i behold the violet past prime, and sable curls all silvered oer with white: when lofty trees i see barren of leaves, which erst from heat did canopy the herd and summers green all girded up in sheaves borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: then of thy beauty do i question make that thou among the wastes of time must go, since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, and die as fast as they see others grow, and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence . o that you were your self, but love you are no longer yours, than you yourself here live, against this coming end you should prepare, and your sweet semblance to some other give . so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination, then you were yourself again after yourselfs decease, when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear . who lets so fair a house fall to decay, which husbandry in honour might uphold, against the stormy gusts of winters day and barren rage of deaths eternal cold ? o none but unthrifts, dear my love you know, you had a father, let your son say so . not from the stars do i my judgement pluck, and yet methinks i have astronomy, but not to tell of good, or evil luck, of plagues, of dearths, or seasons quality, nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell; pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find . but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive, and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert: or else of thee this i prognosticate, thy end is truths and beautys doom and date . when i consider everything that grows holds in perfection but a little moment . that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment . when i perceive that men as plants increase, cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky: vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease, and wear their brave state out of memory . then the conceit of this inconstant stay, sets you most rich in youth before my sight, where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night, and all in war with time for love of you, as he takes from you, i engraft you new . but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant time ? and fortify yourself in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme ? now stand you on the top of happy hours, and many maiden gardens yet unset, with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers, much liker than your painted counterfeit: so should the lines of life that life repair which this times pencil or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live yourself in eyes of men . to give away yourself, keeps yourself still, and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill . who will believe my verse in time to come if it were filled with your most high deserts ? though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life, and shows not half your parts: if i could write the beauty of your eyes, and in fresh numbers number all your graces, the age to come would say this poet lies, such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces . so should my papers yellowed with their age be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue, and your true rights be termed a poets rage, and stretched metre of an antique song . but were some child of yours alive that time, you should live twice,in it, and in my rhyme . shall i compare thee to a summers day ? thou art more lovely and more temperate: rough winds do shake the darling buds of may, and summers lease hath all too short a date: sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, and often is his gold complexion dimmed, and every fair from fair sometime declines, by chance, or natures changing course untrimmed: but thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou owst, nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade, when in eternal lines to time thou growst, so long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long lives this, and this gives life to thee . devouring time blunt thou the lions paws, and make the earth devour her own sweet brood, pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws, and burn the longlived phoenix, in her blood, make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst, and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time to the wide world and all her fading sweets: but i forbid thee one most heinous crime, o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow, nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen, him in thy course untainted do allow, for beautys pattern to succeeding men . yet do thy worst, old time; despite thy wrong, my love shall in my verse ever live young . a womans face with natures own hand painted, hast thou the master mistress of my passion, a womans gentle heart but not acquainted with shifting change as is false womens fashion, an eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling: gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, a man in hue all hues in his controlling, which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth . and for a woman wert thou first created, till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting, and by addition me of thee defeated, by adding one thing to my purpose nothing . but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure, mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure . so is it not with me as with that muse, stirred by a painted beauty to his verse, who heaven it self for ornament doth use, and every fair with his fair doth rehearse, making a couplement of proud compare with sun and moon, with earth and seas rich gems: with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare, that heavens air in this huge rondure hems . o let me true in love but truly write, and then believe me, my love is as fair, as any mothers child, though not so bright as those gold candles fixed in heavens air: let them say more that like of hearsay well, i will not praise that purpose not to sell . my glass shall not persuade me i am old, so long as youth and thou are of one date, but when in thee times furrows i behold, then look i death my days should expiate . for all that beauty that doth cover thee, is but the seemly raiment of my heart, which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me, how can i then be elder than thou art ? o therefore love be of thyself so wary, as i not for my self, but for thee will, bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill . presume not on thy heart when mine is slain, thou gavst me thine not to give back again . as an unperfect actor on the stage, who with his fear is put beside his part, or some fierce thing replete with too much rage, whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart; so i for fear of trust, forget to say, the perfect ceremony of loves rite, and in mine own loves strength seem to decay, oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might: o let my looks be then the eloquence, and dumb presagers of my speaking breast, who plead for love, and look for recompense, more than that tongue that more hath more expressed . o learn to read what silent love hath writ, to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit . mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled, thy beautys form in table of my heart, my body is the frame wherein tis held, and perspective it is best painters art . for through the painter must you see his skill, to find where your true image pictured lies, which in my bosoms shop is hanging still, that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes: now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done, mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee; yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art, they draw but what they see, know not the heart . let those who are in favour with their stars, of public honour and proud titles boast, whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlooked for joy in that i honour most; great princes favourites their fair leaves spread, but as the marigold at the suns eye, and in themselves their pride lies buried, for at a frown they in their glory die . the painful warrior famoused for fight, after a thousand victories once foiled, is from the book of honour razed quite, and all the rest forgot for which he toiled: then happy i that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed . lord of my love, to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit; to thee i send this written embassage to witness duty, not to show my wit . duty so great, which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare, in wanting words to show it; but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it: till whatsoever star that guides my moving, points on me graciously with fair aspect, and puts apparel on my tattered loving, to show me worthy of thy sweet respect, then may i dare to boast how i do love thee, till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me . weary with toil, i haste me to my bed, the dear respose for limbs with travel tired, but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind, when bodys works expired . for then my thoughts, from far where i abide, intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, and keep my drooping eyelids open wide, looking on darkness which the blind do see . save that my souls imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view, which like a jewel hung in ghastly night makes black night beauteous, and her old face new . lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind, for thee, and for my self, no quiet find . how can i then return in happy plight that am debarred the benefit of rest ? when days oppression is not eased by night, but day by night and night by day oppressed . and each though enemies to eithers reign do in consent shake hands to torture me, the one by toil, the other to complain how far i toil, still farther off from thee . i tell the day to please him thou art bright, and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: so flatter i the swartcomplexioned night, when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even . but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer, and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes, i all alone beweep my outcast state, and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, and look upon my self and curse my fate, wishing me like to one more rich in hope, featured like him, like him with friends possessed, desiring this mans art, and that mans scope, with what i most enjoy contented least, yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, haply i think on thee, and then my state, like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate, for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, that then i scorn to change my state with kings . when to the sessions of sweet silent thought, i summon up remembrance of things past, i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought, and with old woes new wail my dear times waste: then can i drown an eye unused to flow for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night, and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe, and moan th expense of many a vanished sight . then can i grieve at grievances foregone, and heavily from woe to woe tell oer the sad account of forebemoaned moan, which i new pay as if not paid before . but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restored, and sorrows end . thy bosom is endeared with all hearts, which i by lacking have supposed dead, and there reigns love and all loves loving parts, and all those friends which i thought buried . how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye, as interest of the dead, which now appear, but things removed that hidden in thee lie . thou art the grave where buried love doth live, hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, who all their parts of me to thee did give, that due of many, now is thine alone . their images i loved, i view in thee, and thou, all they, hast all the all of me . if thou survive my wellcontented day, when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more resurvey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover: compare them with the bettring of the time, and though they be outstripped by every pen, reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme, exceeded by the height of happier men . o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought, had my friends muse grown with this growing age, a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage: but since he died and poets better prove, theirs for their style ill read, his for his love . full many a glorious morning have i seen, flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, kissing with golden face the meadows green; gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy: anon permit the basest clouds to ride, with ugly rack on his celestial face, and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace: even so my sun one early morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow, but out alack, he was but one hour mine, the region cloud hath masked him from me now . yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth, suns of the world may stain, when heavens sun staineth . why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, and make me travel forth without my cloak, to let base clouds oertake me in my way, hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke ? tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face, for no man well of such a salve can speak, that heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: nor can thy shame give physic to my grief, though thou repent, yet i have still the loss, th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offences cross . ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds, and they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds . no more be grieved at that which thou hast done, roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud . all men make faults, and even i in this, authorizing thy trespass with compare, my self corrupting salving thy amiss, excusing thy sins more than thy sins are: for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense; thy adverse party is thy advocate, and gainst my self a lawful plea commence: such civil war is in my love and hate, that i an accessary needs must be, to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me . let me confess that we two must be twain, although our undivided loves are one: so shall those blots that do with me remain, without thy help, by me be borne alone . in our two loves there is but one respect, though in our lives a separable spite, which though it alter not loves sole effect, yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight . i may not evermore acknowledge thee, lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, nor thou with public kindness honour me, unless thou take that honour from thy name: but do not so, i love thee in such sort, as thou being mine, mine is thy good report . as a decrepit father takes delight, to see his active child do deeds of youth, so i, made lame by fortunes dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth . for whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, or any of these all, or all, or more entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, i make my love engrafted to this store: so then i am not lame, poor, nor despised, whilst that this shadow doth such substance give, that i in thy abundance am sufficed, and by a part of all thy glory live: look what is best, that best i wish in thee, this wish i have, then ten times happy me . how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse, thine own sweet argument, too excellent, for every vulgar paper to rehearse ? o give thyself the thanks if aught in me, worthy perusal stand against thy sight, for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee, when thou thyself dost give invention light ? be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate, and he that calls on thee, let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date . if my slight muse do please these curious days, the pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise . o how thy worth with manners may i sing, when thou art all the better part of me ? what can mine own praise to mine own self bring: and what ist but mine own when i praise thee ? even for this, let us divided live, and our dear love lose name of single one, that by this separation i may give: that due to thee which thou deservst alone: o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove, were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, to entertain the time with thoughts of love, which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive . and that thou teachest how to make one twain, by praising him here who doth hence remain . take all my loves, my love, yea take them all, what hast thou then more than thou hadst before ? no love, my love, that thou mayst true love call, all mine was thine, before thou hadst this more: then if for my love, thou my love receivest, i cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest, but yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest . i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty: and yet love knows it is a greater grief to bear greater wrong, than hates known injury . lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, kill me with spites yet we must not be foes . those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, when i am sometime absent from thy heart, thy beauty, and thy years full well befits, for still temptation follows where thou art . gentle thou art, and therefore to be won, beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed . and when a woman woos, what womans son, will sourly leave her till he have prevailed ? ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, and chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth, who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth: hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee, thine by thy beauty being false to me . that thou hast her it is not all my grief, and yet it may be said i loved her dearly, that she hath thee is of my wailing chief, a loss in love that touches me more nearly . loving offenders thus i will excuse ye, thou dost love her, because thou knowst i love her, and for my sake even so doth she abuse me, suffring my friend for my sake to approve her . if i lose thee, my loss is my loves gain, and losing her, my friend hath found that loss, both find each other, and i lose both twain, and both for my sake lay on me this cross, but heres the joy, my friend and i are one, sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone . when most i wink then do mine eyes best see, for all the day they view things unrespected, but when i sleep, in dreams they look on thee, and darkly bright, are bright in dark directed . then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadows form, form happy show, to the clear day with thy much clearer light, when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so ! how would i say mine eyes be blessed made, by looking on thee in the living day, when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade, through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay ! all days are nights to see till i see thee, and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me . if the dull substance of my flesh were thought, injurious distance should not stop my way, for then despite of space i would be brought, from limits far remote, where thou dost stay, no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee, for nimble thought can jump both sea and land, as soon as think the place where he would be . but ah, thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, but that so much of earth and water wrought, i must attend, times leisure with my moan . receiving nought by elements so slow, but heavy tears, badges of eithers woe . the other two, slight air, and purging fire, are both with thee, wherever i abide, the first my thought, the other my desire, these presentabsent with swift motion slide . for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee, my life being made of four, with two alone, sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy . until lifes composition be recured, by those swift messengers returned from thee, who even but now come back again assured, of thy fair health, recounting it to me . this told, i joy, but then no longer glad, i send them back again and straight grow sad . mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, how to divide the conquest of thy sight, mine eye, my heart thy pictures sight would bar, my heart, mine eye the freedom of that right, my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, a closet never pierced with crystal eyes; but the defendant doth that plea deny, and says in him thy fair appearance lies . to side this title is impanelled a quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, and by their verdict is determined the clear eyes moiety, and the dear hearts part . as thus, mine eyes due is thy outward part, and my hearts right, thy inward love of heart . betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took, and each doth good turns now unto the other, when that mine eye is famished for a look, or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother; with my loves picture then my eye doth feast, and to the painted banquet bids my heart: another time mine eye is my hearts guest, and in his thoughts of love doth share a part . so either by thy picture or my love, thyself away, art present still with me, for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, and i am still with them, and they with thee . or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight awakes my heart, to hearts and eyes delight . how careful was i when i took my way, each trifle under truest bars to thrust, that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust ! but thou, to whom my jewels trifles are, most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief, thou best of dearest, and mine only care, art left the prey of every vulgar thief . thee have i not locked up in any chest, save where thou art not, though i feel thou art, within the gentle closure of my breast, from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part, and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear, for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear . against that time if ever that time come when i shall see thee frown on my defects, when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, called to that audit by advised respects, against that time when thou shalt strangely pass, and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye, when love converted from the thing it was shall reasons find of settled gravity; against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert, and this my hand, against my self uprear, to guard the lawful reasons on thy part, to leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws, since why to love, i can allege no cause . how heavy do i journey on the way, when what i seek my weary travels end doth teach that case and that repose to say thus far the miles are measured from thy friend . the beast that bears me, tired with my woe, plods dully on, to bear that weight in me, as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider loved not speed being made from thee: the bloody spur cannot provoke him on, that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide, which heavily he answers with a groan, more sharp to me than spurring to his side, for that same groan doth put this in my mind, my grief lies onward and my joy behind . thus can my love excuse the slow offence, of my dull bearer, when from thee i speed, from where thou art, why should i haste me thence ? till i return of posting is no need . o what excuse will my poor beast then find, when swift extremity can seem but slow ? then should i spur though mounted on the wind, in winged speed no motion shall i know, then can no horse with my desire keep pace, therefore desire of perfectst love being made shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race, but love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade: since from thee going, he went wilfulslow, towards thee ill run, and give him leave to go . so am i as the rich whose blessed key, can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure, the which he will not every hour survey, for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure . therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare, since seldom coming in that long year set, like stones of worth they thinly placed are, or captain jewels in the carcanet . so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, to make some special instant specialblest, by new unfolding his imprisoned pride . blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope, being had to triumph, being lacked to hope . what is your substance, whereof are you made, that millions of strange shadows on you tend ? since every one, hath every one, one shade, and you but one, can every shadow lend: describe adonis and the counterfeit, is poorly imitated after you, on helens cheek all art of beauty set, and you in grecian tires are painted new: speak of the spring, and foison of the year, the one doth shadow of your beauty show, the other as your bounty doth appear, and you in every blessed shape we know . in all external grace you have some part, but you like none, none you for constant heart . o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem, by that sweet ornament which truth doth give ! the rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour, which doth in it live: the canker blooms have full as deep a dye, as the perfumed tincture of the roses, hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly, when summers breath their masked buds discloses: but for their virtue only is their show, they live unwooed, and unrespected fade, die to themselves . sweet roses do not so, of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made: and so of you, beauteous and lovely youth, when that shall fade, my verse distills your truth . not marble, nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme, but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time . when wasteful war shall statues overturn, and broils root out the work of masonry, nor mars his sword, nor wars quick fire shall burn: the living record of your memory . gainst death, and alloblivious enmity shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room, even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom . so till the judgement that yourself arise, you live in this, and dwell in lovers eyes . sweet love renew thy force, be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite, which but today by feeding is allayed, tomorrow sharpened in his former might . so love be thou, although today thou fill thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness, tomorrow see again, and do not kill the spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness: let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore, where two contracted new, come daily to the banks, that when they see: return of love, more blest may be the view . or call it winter, which being full of care, makes summers welcome, thrice more wished, more rare . being your slave what should i do but tend, upon the hours, and times of your desire ? i have no precious time at all to spend; nor services to do till you require . nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour, whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you, nor think the bitterness of absence sour, when you have bid your servant once adieu . nor dare i question with my jealous thought, where you may be, or your affairs suppose, but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are, how happy you make those . so true a fool is love, that in your will, though you do any thing he thinks no ill . that god forbid, that made me first your slave, i should in thought control your times of pleasure, or at your hand th account of hours to crave, being your vassal bound to stay your leisure . o let me suffer being at your beck th imprisoned absence of your liberty, and patience tame to sufferance bide each check, without accusing you of injury . be where you list, your charter is so strong, that you yourself may privilage your time to what you will, to you it doth belong, yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime . i am to wait, though waiting so be hell, not blame your pleasure be it ill or well . if there be nothing new, but that which is, hath been before, how are our brains beguiled, which labouring for invention bear amiss the second burthen of a former child ! o that record could with a backward look, even of five hundred courses of the sun, show me your image in some antique book, since mind at first in character was done . that i might see what the old world could say, to this composed wonder of your frame, whether we are mended, or whether better they, or whether revolution be the same . o sure i am the wits of former days, to subjects worse have given admiring praise . like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, so do our minutes hasten to their end, each changing place with that which goes before, in sequent toil all forwards do contend . nativity once in the main of light, crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned, crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight, and time that gave, doth now his gift confound . time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, and delves the parallels in beautys brow, feeds on the rarities of natures truth, and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow . and yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand . is it thy will, thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night ? dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken, while shadows like to thee do mock my sight ? is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry, to find out shames and idle hours in me, the scope and tenure of thy jealousy ? o no, thy love though much, is not so great, it is my love that keeps mine eye awake, mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, to play the watchman ever for thy sake . for thee watch i, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere, from me far off, with others all too near . sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye, and all my soul, and all my every part; and for this sin there is no remedy, it is so grounded inward in my heart . methinks no face so gracious is as mine, no shape so true, no truth of such account, and for my self mine own worth do define, as i all other in all worths surmount . but when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity, mine own selflove quite contrary i read: self, so selfloving were iniquity . tis thee, myself, that for myself i praise, painting my age with beauty of thy days . against my love shall be as i am now with times injurious hand crushed and oerworn, when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn hath travelled on to ages steepy night, and all those beauties whereof now hes king are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, stealing away the treasure of his spring: for such a time do i now fortify against confounding ages cruel knife, that he shall never cut from memory my sweet loves beauty, though my lovers life . his beauty shall in these black lines be seen, and they shall live, and he in them still green . when i have seen by times fell hand defaced the richproud cost of outworn buried age, when sometime lofty towers i see downrased, and brass eternal slave to mortal rage . when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore, and the firm soil win of the watery main, increasing store with loss, and loss with store . when i have seen such interchange of state, or state it self confounded, to decay, ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate: that time will come and take my love away . this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have, that which it fears to lose . since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, but sad mortality oersways their power, how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, whose action is no stronger than a flower ? o how shall summers honey breath hold out, against the wrackful siege of battring days, when rocks impregnable are not so stout, nor gates of steel so strong but time decays ? o fearful meditation, where alack, shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid ? or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back, or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ? o none, unless this miracle have might, that in black ink my love may still shine bright . tired with all these, for restful death i cry: as to behold desert a beggar born, and needy nothing trimmed in jollity, and purest faith unhappily forsworn, and gilded honour shamefully misplaced, and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, and right perfection wrongfully disgraced, and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tonguetied by authority, and folly, doctorlike, controlling skill, and simple truth miscalled simplicity, and captive good attending captain ill . tired with all these, from these would i be gone, save that to die, i leave my love alone . ah wherefore with infection should he live, and with his presence grace impiety, that sin by him advantage should achieve, and lace it self with his society ? why should false painting imitate his cheek, and steal dead seeming of his living hue ? why should poor beauty indirectly seek, roses of shadow, since his rose is true ? why should he live, now nature bankrupt is, beggared of blood to blush through lively veins, for she hath no exchequer now but his, and proud of many, lives upon his gains ? o him she stores, to show what wealth she had, in days long since, before these last so bad . thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, when beauty lived and died as flowers do now, before these bastard signs of fair were born, or durst inhabit on a living brow: before the golden tresses of the dead, the right of sepulchres, were shorn away, to live a second life on second head, ere beautys dead fleece made another gay: in him those holy antique hours are seen, without all ornament, it self and true, making no summer of anothers green, robbing no old to dress his beauty new, and him as for a map doth nature store, to show false art what beauty was of yore . those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view, want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend: all tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due, uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend . thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned, but those same tongues that give thee so thine own, in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown . they look into the beauty of thy mind, and that in guess they measure by thy deeds, then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: but why thy odour matcheth not thy show, the soil is this, that thou dost common grow . that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect, for slanders mark was ever yet the fair, the ornament of beauty is suspect, a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air . so thou be good, slander doth but approve, thy worth the greater being wooed of time, for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, and thou presentst a pure unstained prime . thou hast passed by the ambush of young days, either not assailed, or victor being charged, yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise, to tie up envy, evermore enlarged, if some suspect of ill masked not thy show, then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe . no longer mourn for me when i am dead, than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell: nay if you read this line, remember not, the hand that writ it, for i love you so, that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, if thinking on me then should make you woe . o if, i say, you look upon this verse, when i perhaps compounded am with clay, do not so much as my poor name rehearse; but let your love even with my life decay . lest the wise world should look into your moan, and mock you with me after i am gone . o lest the world should task you to recite, what merit lived in me that you should love after my death, dear love, forget me quite, for you in me can nothing worthy prove . unless you would devise some virtuous lie, to do more for me than mine own desert, and hang more praise upon deceased i, than niggard truth would willingly impart: o lest your true love may seem false in this, that you for love speak well of me untrue, my name be buried where my body is, and live no more to shame nor me, nor you . for i am shamed by that which i bring forth, and so should you, to love things nothing worth . that time of year thou mayst in me behold, when yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold, bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang . in me thou seest the twilight of such day, as after sunset fadeth in the west, which by and by black night doth take away, deaths second self that seals up all in rest . in me thou seest the glowing of such fire, that on the ashes of his youth doth lie, as the deathbed, whereon it must expire, consumed with that which it was nourished by . this thou perceivst, which makes thy love more strong, to love that well, which thou must leave ere long . but be contented when that fell arrest, without all bail shall carry me away, my life hath in this line some interest, which for memorial still with thee shall stay . when thou reviewest this, thou dost review, the very part was consecrate to thee, the earth can have but earth, which is his due, my spirit is thine the better part of me, so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, the prey of worms, my body being dead, the coward conquest of a wretchs knife, too base of thee to be remembered, the worth of that, is that which it contains, and that is this, and this with thee remains . so are you to my thoughts as food to life, or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground; and for the peace of you i hold such strife as twixt a miser and his wealth is found . now proud as an enjoyer, and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure, now counting best to be with you alone, then bettered that the world may see my pleasure, sometime all full with feasting on your sight, and by and by clean starved for a look, possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had, or must from you be took . thus do i pine and surfeit day by day, or gluttoning on all, or all away . why is my verse so barren of new pride ? so far from variation or quick change ? why with the time do i not glance aside to newfound methods, and to compounds strange ? why write i still all one, ever the same, and keep invention in a noted weed, that every word doth almost tell my name, showing their birth, and where they did proceed ? o know sweet love i always write of you, and you and love are still my argument: so all my best is dressing old words new, spending again what is already spent: for as the sun is daily new and old, so is my love still telling what is told . thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear, thy dial how thy precious minutes waste, these vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear, and of this book, this learning mayst thou taste . the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show, of mouthed graves will give thee memory, thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know, times thievish progress to eternity . look what thy memory cannot contain, commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find those children nursed, delivered from thy brain, to take a new acquaintance of thy mind . these offices, so oft as thou wilt look, shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book . so oft have i invoked thee for my muse, and found such fair assistance in my verse, as every alien pen hath got my use, and under thee their poesy disperse . thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing, and heavy ignorance aloft to fly, have added feathers to the learneds wing, and given grace a double majesty . yet be most proud of that which i compile, whose influence is thine, and born of thee, in others works thou dost but mend the style, and arts with thy sweet graces graced be . but thou art all my art, and dost advance as high as learning, my rude ignorance . whilst i alone did call upon thy aid, my verse alone had all thy gentle grace, but now my gracious numbers are decayed, and my sick muse doth give an other place . i grant sweet love thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen, yet what of thee thy poet doth invent, he robs thee of, and pays it thee again, he lends thee virtue, and he stole that word, from thy behaviour, beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek: he can afford no praise to thee, but what in thee doth live . then thank him not for that which he doth say, since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay . o how i faint when i of you do write, knowing a better spirit doth use your name, and in the praise thereof spends all his might, to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame . but since your worth, wide as the ocean is, the humble as the proudest sail doth bear, my saucy bark inferior far to his on your broad main doth wilfully appear . your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride, or being wrecked i am a worthless boat, he of tall building, and of goodly pride . then if he thrive and i be cast away, the worst was this: my love was my decay . or i shall live your epitaph to make, or you survive when i in earth am rotten, from hence your memory death cannot take, although in me each part will be forgotten . your name from hence immortal life shall have, though i once gone to all the world must die, the earth can yield me but a common grave, when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie, your monument shall be my gentle verse, which eyes not yet created shall oerread, and tongues to be, your being shall rehearse, when all the breathers of this world are dead, you still shall live, such virtue hath my pen, where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men . i grant thou wert not married to my muse, and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject, blessing every book . thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, finding thy worth a limit past my praise, and therefore art enforced to seek anew, some fresher stamp of the timebettering days . and do so love, yet when they have devised, what strained touches rhetoric can lend, thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized, in true plain words, by thy truetelling friend . and their gross painting might be better used, where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused . i never saw that you did painting need, and therefore to your fair no painting set, i found or thought i found you did exceed, that barren tender of a poets debt: and therefore have i slept in your report, that you yourself being extant well might show, how far a modern quill doth come too short, speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow . this silence for my sin you did impute, which shall be most my glory being dumb, for i impair not beauty being mute, when others would give life, and bring a tomb . there lives more life in one of your fair eyes, than both your poets can in praise devise . who is it that says most, which can say more, than this rich praise: that you alone are you, in whose confine immured is the store, which should example where your equal grew . lean penury within that pen doth dwell, that to his subject lends not some small glory, but he that writes of you, if he can tell, that you are you, so dignifies his story . let him but copy what in you is writ, not making worse what nature made so clear, and such a counterpart shall fame his wit, making his style admired every where . you to your beauteous blessings add a curse, being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse . my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still, while comments of your praise richly compiled, reserve their character with golden quill, and precious phrase by all the muses filed . i think good thoughts, whilst other write good words, and like unlettered clerk still cry amen, to every hymn that able spirit affords, in polished form of well refined pen . hearing you praised, i say tis so, tis true, and to the most of praise add something more, but that is in my thought, whose love to you though words come hindmost holds his rank before, then others, for the breath of words respect, me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect . was it the proud full sail of his great verse, bound for the prize of all too precious you, that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, making their tomb the womb wherein they grew ? was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write, above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead ? no, neither he, nor his compeers by night giving him aid, my verse astonished . he nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence, as victors of my silence cannot boast, i was not sick of any fear from thence . but when your countenance filled up his line, then lacked i matter, that enfeebled mine . farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing, and like enough thou knowst thy estimate, the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing: my bonds in thee are all determinate . for how do i hold thee but by thy granting, and for that riches where is my deserving ? the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, and so my patent back again is swerving . thyself thou gavst, thy own worth then not knowing, or me to whom thou gavst it, else mistaking, so thy great gift upon misprision growing, comes home again, on better judgement making . thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter, in sleep a king, but waking no such matter . when thou shalt be disposed to set me light, and place my merit in the eye of scorn, upon thy side, against my self ill fight, and prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn: with mine own weakness being best acquainted, upon thy part i can set down a story of faults concealed, wherein i am attainted: that thou in losing me, shalt win much glory: and i by this will be a gainer too, for bending all my loving thoughts on thee, the injuries that to my self i do, doing thee vantage, doublevantage me . such is my love, to thee i so belong, that for thy right, my self will bear all wrong . say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, and i will comment upon that offence, speak of my lameness, and i straight will halt: against thy reasons making no defence . thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill, to set a form upon desired change, as ill my self disgrace, knowing thy will, i will acquaintance strangle and look strange: be absent from thy walks and in my tongue, thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, lest i, too much profane, should do it wrong, and haply of our old acquaintance tell . for thee, against my self ill vow debate, for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate . then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now, now while the world is bent my deeds to cross, join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, and do not drop in for an afterloss: ah do not, when my heart hath scaped this sorrow, come in the rearward of a conquered woe, give not a windy night a rainy morrow, to linger out a purposed overthrow . if thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, when other petty griefs have done their spite, but in the onset come, so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortunes might . and other strains of woe, which now seem woe, compared with loss of thee, will not seem so . some glory in their birth, some in their skill, some in their wealth, some in their bodys force, some in their garments though newfangled ill: some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse . and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, wherein it finds a joy above the rest, but these particulars are not my measure, all these i better in one general best . thy love is better than high birth to me, richer than wealth, prouder than garments costs, of more delight than hawks and horses be: and having thee, of all mens pride i boast . wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take, all this away, and me most wretched make . but do thy worst to steal thyself away, for term of life thou art assured mine, and life no longer than thy love will stay, for it depends upon that love of thine . then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs, when in the least of them my life hath end, i see, a better state to me belongs than that, which on thy humour doth depend . thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, since that my life on thy revolt doth lie, o what a happy title do i find, happy to have thy love, happy to die ! but whats so blessedfair that fears no blot ? thou mayst be false, and yet i know it not . so shall i live, supposing thou art true, like a deceived husband, so loves face, may still seem love to me, though altered new: thy looks with me, thy heart in other place . for there can live no hatred in thine eye, therefore in that i cannot know thy change, in manys looks, the false hearts history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange . but heaven in thy creation did decree, that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell, whateer thy thoughts, or thy hearts workings be, thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell . how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow, if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show . they that have power to hurt, and will do none, that do not do the thing, they most do show, who moving others, are themselves as stone, unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow: they rightly do inherit heavens graces, and husband natures riches from expense, they are the lords and owners of their faces, others, but stewards of their excellence: the summers flower is to the summer sweet, though to it self, it only live and die, but if that flower with base infection meet, the basest weed outbraves his dignity: for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds, lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds . how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame, which like a canker in the fragrant rose, doth spot the beauty of thy budding name ! o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose ! that tongue that tells the story of thy days, making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise, naming thy name, blesses an ill report . o what a mansion have those vices got, which for their habitation chose out thee, where beautys veil doth cover every blot, and all things turns to fair, that eyes can see ! take heed dear heart of this large privilege, the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge . some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness, some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport, both grace and faults are loved of more and less: thou makst faults graces, that to thee resort: as on the finger of a throned queen, the basest jewel will be well esteemed: so are those errors that in thee are seen, to truths translated, and for true things deemed . how many lambs might the stern wolf betray, if like a lamb he could his looks translate ! how many gazers mightst thou lead away, if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state ! but do not so, i love thee in such sort, as thou being mine, mine is thy good report . how like a winter hath my absence been from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year ! what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen ! what old decembers bareness everywhere ! and yet this time removed was summers time, the teeming autumn big with rich increase, bearing the wanton burden of the prime, like widowed wombs after their lords decease: yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit, for summer and his pleasures wait on thee, and thou away, the very birds are mute . or if they sing, tis with so dull a cheer, that leaves look pale, dreading the winters near . from you have i been absent in the spring, when proudpied april dressed in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing: that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him . yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue, could make me any summers story tell: or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew: nor did i wonder at the lilys white, nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose, they were but sweet, but figures of delight: drawn after you, you pattern of all those . yet seemed it winter still, and you away, as with your shadow i with these did play . the forward violet thus did i chide, sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, if not from my loves breath ? the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells, in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed . the lily i condemned for thy hand, and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair, the roses fearfully on thorns did stand, one blushing shame, another white despair: a third nor red, nor white, had stoln of both, and to his robbery had annexed thy breath, but for his theft in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death . more flowers i noted, yet i none could see, but sweet, or colour it had stoln from thee . where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long, to speak of that which gives thee all thy might ? spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song, darkening thy power to lend base subjects light ? return forgetful muse, and straight redeem, in gentle numbers time so idly spent, sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem, and gives thy pen both skill and argument . rise resty muse, my loves sweet face survey, if time have any wrinkle graven there, if any, be a satire to decay, and make times spoils despised everywhere . give my love fame faster than time wastes life, so thou preventst his scythe, and crooked knife . o truant muse what shall be thy amends, for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed ? both truth and beauty on my love depends: so dost thou too, and therein dignified: make answer muse, wilt thou not haply say, truth needs no colour with his colour fixed, beauty no pencil, beautys truth to lay: but best is best, if never intermixed ? because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb ? excuse not silence so, fort lies in thee, to make him much outlive a gilded tomb: and to be praised of ages yet to be . then do thy office muse, i teach thee how, to make him seem long hence, as he shows now . my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming, i love not less, though less the show appear, that love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming, the owners tongue doth publish every where . our love was new, and then but in the spring, when i was wont to greet it with my lays, as philomel in summers front doth sing, and stops her pipe in growth of riper days: not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, but that wild music burthens every bough, and sweets grown common lose their dear delight . therefore like her, i sometime hold my tongue: because i would not dull you with my song . alack what poverty my muse brings forth, that having such a scope to show her pride, the argument all bare is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside . o blame me not if i no more can write ! look in your glass and there appears a face, that overgoes my blunt invention quite, dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace . were it not sinful then striving to mend, to mar the subject that before was well ? for to no other pass my verses tend, than of your graces and your gifts to tell . and more, much more than in my verse can sit, your own glass shows you, when you look in it . to me fair friend you never can be old, for as you were when first your eye i eyed, such seems your beauty still: three winters cold, have from the forests shook three summers pride, three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned, in process of the seasons have i seen, three april perfumes in three hot junes burned, since first i saw you fresh which yet are green . ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand, steal from his figure, and no pace perceived, so your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived . for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred, ere you were born was beautys summer dead . let not my love be called idolatry, nor my beloved as an idol show, since all alike my songs and praises be to one, of one, still such, and ever so . kind is my love today, tomorrow kind, still constant in a wondrous excellence, therefore my verse to constancy confined, one thing expressing, leaves out difference . fair, kind, and true, is all my argument, fair, kind, and true, varying to other words, and in this change is my invention spent, three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords . fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone . which three till now, never kept seat in one . when in the chronicle of wasted time, i see descriptions of the fairest wights, and beauty making beautiful old rhyme, in praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights, then in the blazon of sweet beautys best, of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, i see their antique pen would have expressed, even such a beauty as you master now . so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time, all you prefiguring, and for they looked but with divining eyes, they had not skill enough your worth to sing: for we which now behold these present days, have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise . not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul, of the wide world, dreaming on things to come, can yet the lease of my true love control, supposed as forfeit to a confined doom . the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured, and the sad augurs mock their own presage, incertainties now crown themselves assured, and peace proclaims olives of endless age . now with the drops of this most balmy time, my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes, since spite of him ill live in this poor rhyme, while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes . and thou in this shalt find thy monument, when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent . whats in the brain that ink may character, which hath not figured to thee my true spirit, whats new to speak, what now to register, that may express my love, or thy dear merit ? nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine, i must each day say oer the very same, counting no old thing old, thou mine, i thine, even as when first i hallowed thy fair name . so that eternal love in loves fresh case, weighs not the dust and injury of age, nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, but makes antiquity for aye his page, finding the first conceit of love there bred, where time and outward form would show it dead . o never say that i was false of heart, though absence seemed my flame to qualify, as easy might i from my self depart, as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie: that is my home of love, if i have ranged, like him that travels i return again, just to the time, not with the time exchanged, so that my self bring water for my stain, never believe though in my nature reigned, all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, that it could so preposterously be stained, to leave for nothing all thy sum of good: for nothing this wide universe i call, save thou my rose, in it thou art my all . alas tis true, i have gone here and there, and made my self a motley to the view, gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, made old offences of affections new . most true it is, that i have looked on truth askance and strangely: but by all above, these blenches gave my heart another youth, and worse essays proved thee my best of love . now all is done, have what shall have no end, mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof, to try an older friend, a god in love, to whom i am confined . then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, even to thy pure and most most loving breast . o for my sake do you with fortune chide, the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, that did not better for my life provide, than public means which public manners breeds . thence comes it that my name receives a brand, and almost thence my nature is subdued to what it works in, like the dyers hand: pity me then, and wish i were renewed, whilst like a willing patient i will drink, potions of eisel gainst my strong infection, no bitterness that i will bitter think, nor double penance to correct correction . pity me then dear friend, and i assure ye, even that your pity is enough to cure me . your love and pity doth th impression fill, which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow, for what care i who calls me well or ill, so you oergreen my bad, my good allow ? you are my all the world, and i must strive, to know my shames and praises from your tongue, none else to me, nor i to none alive, that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong . in so profound abysm i throw all care of others voices, that my adders sense, to critic and to flatterer stopped are: mark how with my neglect i do dispense . you are so strongly in my purpose bred, that all the world besides methinks are dead . since i left you, mine eye is in my mind, and that which governs me to go about, doth part his function, and is partly blind, seems seeing, but effectually is out: for it no form delivers to the heart of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch, of his quick objects hath the mind no part, nor his own vision holds what it doth catch: for if it see the rudst or gentlest sight, the most sweet favour or deformedst creature, the mountain, or the sea, the day, or night: the crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature . incapable of more, replete with you, my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue . or whether doth my mind being crowned with you drink up the monarchs plague this flattery ? or whether shall i say mine eye saith true, and that your love taught it this alchemy ? to make of monsters, and things indigest, such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, creating every bad a perfect best as fast as objects to his beams assemble: o tis the first, tis flattery in my seeing, and my great mind most kingly drinks it up, mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing, and to his palate doth prepare the cup . if it be poisoned, tis the lesser sin, that mine eye loves it and doth first begin . those lines that i before have writ do lie, even those that said i could not love you dearer, yet then my judgement knew no reason why, my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer, but reckoning time, whose millioned accidents creep in twixt vows, and change decrees of kings, tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharpst intents, divert strong minds to the course of altring things: alas why fearing of times tyranny, might i not then say now i love you best, when i was certain oer incertainty, crowning the present, doubting of the rest ? love is a babe, then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow . let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments, love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove . o no, it is an everfixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandring bark, whose worths unknown, although his height be taken . loves not times fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out even to the edge of doom: if this be error and upon me proved, i never writ, nor no man ever loved . accuse me thus, that i have scanted all, wherein i should your great deserts repay, forgot upon your dearest love to call, whereto all bonds do tie me day by day, that i have frequent been with unknown minds, and given to time your own dearpurchased right, that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight . book both my wilfulness and errors down, and on just proof surmise, accumulate, bring me within the level of your frown, but shoot not at me in your wakened hate: since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love . like as to make our appetite more keen with eager compounds we our palate urge, as to prevent our maladies unseen, we sicken to shun sickness when we purge . even so being full of your neercloying sweetness, to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding; and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness, to be diseased ere that there was true needing . thus policy in love t anticipate the ills that were not, grew to faults assured, and brought to medicine a healthful state which rank of goodness would by ill be cured . but thence i learn and find the lesson true, drugs poison him that so fell sick of you . what potions have i drunk of siren tears distilled from limbecks foul as hell within, applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears, still losing when i saw my self to win ! what wretched errors hath my heart committed, whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never ! how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever ! o benefit of ill, now i find true that better is, by evil still made better . and ruined love when it is built anew grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater . so i return rebuked to my content, and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent . that you were once unkind befriends me now, and for that sorrow, which i then did feel, needs must i under my transgression bow, unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel . for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours, yhave passed a hell of time, and i a tyrant have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffered in your crime . o that our night of woe might have remembered my deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits, and soon to you, as you to me then tendered the humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits ! but that your trespass now becomes a fee, mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me . tis better to be vile than vile esteemed, when not to be, receives reproach of being, and the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed, not by our feeling, but by others seeing . for why should others false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood ? or on my frailties why are frailer spies, which in their wills count bad what i think good ? no, i am that i am, and they that level at my abuses, reckon up their own, i may be straight though they themselves be bevel; by their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown unless this general evil they maintain, all men are bad and in their badness reign . thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain full charactered with lasting memory, which shall above that idle rank remain beyond all date even to eternity . or at the least, so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist, till each to razed oblivion yield his part of thee, thy record never can be missed: that poor retention could not so much hold, nor need i tallies thy dear love to score, therefore to give them from me was i bold, to trust those tables that receive thee more: to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me . no ! time, thou shalt not boast that i do change, thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel, nothing strange, they are but dressings of a former sight: our dates are brief, and therefore we admire, what thou dost foist upon us that is old, and rather make them born to our desire, than think that we before have heard them told: thy registers and thee i both defy, not wondring at the present, nor the past, for thy records, and what we see doth lie, made more or less by thy continual haste: this i do vow and this shall ever be, i will be true despite thy scythe and thee . if my dear love were but the child of state, it might for fortunes bastard be unfathered, as subject to times love or to times hate, weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered . no it was builded far from accident, it suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent, whereto th inviting time our fashion calls: it fears not policy that heretic, which works on leases of shortnumbered hours, but all alone stands hugely politic, that it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers . to this i witness call the fools of time, which die for goodness, who have lived for crime . weret aught to me i bore the canopy, with my extern the outward honouring, or laid great bases for eternity, which proves more short than waste or ruining ? have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all, and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet; forgoing simple savour, pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent ? no, let me be obsequious in thy heart, and take thou my oblation, poor but free, which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art, but mutual render, only me for thee . hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul when most impeached, stands least in thy control . o thou my lovely boy who in thy power, dost hold times fickle glass his fickle hour: who hast by waning grown, and therein showst, thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growst . if nature sovereign mistress over wrack as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back, she keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill may time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill . yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure, she may detain, but not still keep her treasure ! her audit though delayed answered must be, and her quietus is to render thee . in the old age black was not counted fair, or if it were it bore not beautys name: but now is black beautys successive heir, and beauty slandered with a bastard shame, for since each hand hath put on natures power, fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face, sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower, but is profaned, if not lives in disgrace . therefore my mistress eyes are raven black, her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem at such who not born fair no beauty lack, slandering creation with a false esteem, yet so they mourn becoming of their woe, that every tongue says beauty should look so . how oft when thou, my music, music playst, upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst the wiry concord that mine ear confounds, do i envy those jacks that nimble leap, to kiss the tender inward of thy hand, whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap, at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand . to be so tickled they would change their state and situation with those dancing chips, oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, making dead wood more blest than living lips, since saucy jacks so happy are in this, give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss . th expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action, and till action, lust is perjured, murdrous, bloody full of blame, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, enjoyed no sooner but despised straight, past reason hunted, and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait, on purpose laid to make the taker mad . mad in pursuit and in possession so, had, having, and in quest, to have extreme, a bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe; before a joy proposed behind a dream . all this the world well knows yet none knows well, to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell . my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun, coral is far more red, than her lips red, if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun: if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head: i have seen roses damasked, red and white, but no such roses see i in her cheeks, and in some perfumes is there more delight, than in the breath that from my mistress reeks . i love to hear her speak, yet well i know, that music hath a far more pleasing sound: i grant i never saw a goddess go; my mistress when she walks treads on the ground . and yet by heaven i think my love as rare, as any she belied with false compare . thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel . yet in good faith some say that thee behold, thy face hath not the power to make love groan; to say they err, i dare not be so bold, although i swear it to my self alone . and to be sure that is not false i swear, a thousand groans but thinking on thy face, one on anothers neck do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgements place . in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds, and thence this slander as i think proceeds . thine eyes i love, and they as pitying me, knowing thy heart torment me with disdain, have put on black, and loving mourners be, looking with pretty ruth upon my pain . and truly not the morning sun of heaven better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, nor that full star that ushers in the even doth half that glory to the sober west as those two mourning eyes become thy face: o let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace, and suit thy pity like in every part . then will i swear beauty herself is black, and all they foul that thy complexion lack . beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me; ist not enough to torture me alone, but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be ? me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken, and my next self thou harder hast engrossed, of him, my self, and thee i am forsaken, a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed: prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward, but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail, whoeer keeps me, let my heart be his guard, thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol . and yet thou wilt, for i being pent in thee, perforce am thine and all that is in me . so now i have confessed that he is thine, and i my self am mortgaged to thy will, my self ill forfeit, so that other mine, thou wilt restore to be my comfort still: but thou wilt not, nor he will not be free, for thou art covetous, and he is kind, he learned but suretylike to write for me, under that bond that him as fist doth bind . the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, thou usurer that putst forth all to use, and sue a friend, came debtor for my sake, so him i lose through my unkind abuse . him have i lost, thou hast both him and me, he pays the whole, and yet am i not free . whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will, and will to boot, and will in overplus, more than enough am i that vex thee still, to thy sweet will making addition thus . wilt thou whose will is large and spacious, not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ? shall will in others seem right gracious, and in my will no fair acceptance shine ? the sea all water, yet receives rain still, and in abundance addeth to his store, so thou being rich in will add to thy will one will of mine to make thy large will more . let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill, think all but one, and me in that one will . if thy soul check thee that i come so near, swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will, and will thy soul knows is admitted there, thus far for love, my lovesuit sweet fulfil . will will fulfil the treasure of thy love, ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one, in things of great receipt with case we prove, among a number one is reckoned none . then in the number let me pass untold, though in thy stores account i one must be, for nothing hold me, so it please thee hold, that nothing me, a something sweet to thee . make but my name thy love, and love that still, and then thou lovst me for my name is will . thou blind fool love, what dost thou to mine eyes, that they behold and see not what they see ? they know what beauty is, see where it lies, yet what the best is, take the worst to be . if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks, be anchored in the bay where all men ride, why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks, whereto the judgement of my heart is tied ? why should my heart think that a several plot, which my heart knows the wide worlds common place ? or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not to put fair truth upon so foul a face ? in things right true my heart and eyes have erred, and to this false plague are they now transferred . when my love swears that she is made of truth, i do believe, her though i know she lies, that she might think me some untutored youth, unlearned in the worlds false subtleties . thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, although she knows my days are past the best, simply i credit her falsespeaking tongue; on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed . but wherefore says she not she is unjust ? and wherefore say not i that i am old ? o loves best habit is in seeming trust, and age in love loves not to have years told . therefore i lie with her, and she with me, and in our faults by lies we flattered be . o call not me to justify the wrong, that thy unkindness lays upon my heart, wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue, use power with power, and slay me not by art, tell me thou lovst elsewhere; but in my sight, dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside, what needst thou wound with cunning when thy might is more than my oerpressed defence can bide ? let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows, her pretty looks have been mine enemies, and therefore from my face she turns my foes, that they elsewhere might dart their injuries: yet do not so, but since i am near slain, kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain . be wise as thou art cruel, do not press my tonguetied patience with too much disdain: lest sorrow lend me words and words express, the manner of my pitywanting pain . if i might teach thee wit better it were, though not to love, yet love to tell me so, as testy sick men when their deaths be near, no news but health from their physicians know . for if i should despair i should grow mad, and in my madness might speak ill of thee, now this illwresting world is grown so bad, mad slanderers by mad ears believed be . that i may not be so, nor thou belied, bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide . in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes, for they in thee a thousand errors note, but tis my heart that loves what they despise, who in despite of view is pleased to dote . nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted, nor tender feeling to base touches prone, nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone: but my five wits, nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be: only my plague thus far i count my gain, that she that makes me sin, awards me pain . love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate, hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving, o but with mine, compare thou thine own state, and thou shalt find it merits not reproving, or if it do, not from those lips of thine, that have profaned their scarlet ornaments, and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, robbed others beds revenues of their rents . be it lawful i love thee as thou lovst those, whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee, root pity in thy heart that when it grows, thy pity may deserve to pitied be . if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide, by selfexample mayst thou be denied . lo as a careful huswife runs to catch, one of her feathered creatures broke away, sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay: whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, cries to catch her whose busy care is bent, to follow that which flies before her face: not prizing her poor infants discontent; so runst thou after that which flies from thee, whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind, but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me: and play the mothers part, kiss me, be kind . so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will, if thou turn back and my loud crying still . two loves i have, of comfort and despair, which, like two spirits, do suggest me still: the better angel is a man right fair, the worser spirit a woman coloured ill . to win me soon to hell my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side, and would corrupt my saint to be a devil, wooing his purity with her foul pride . and whether that my angel be turned fiend suspect i may, yet not directly tell; but being both from me both to each friend, i guess one angel in anothers hell . yet this shall i neer know, but live in doubt, till my bad angel fire my good one out . those lips that loves own hand did make, breathed forth the sound that said i hate, to me that languished for her sake: but when she saw my woeful state, straight in her heart did mercy come, chiding that tongue that ever sweet, was used in giving gentle doom: and taught it thus anew to greet: i hate she altered with an end, that followed it as gentle day, doth follow night who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away . i hate, from hate away she threw, and saved my life saying not you . poor soul the centre of my sinful earth, my sinful earth these rebel powers array, why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay ? why so large cost having so short a lease, dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend ? shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge ? is this thy bodys end ? then soul live thou upon thy servants loss, and let that pine to aggravate thy store; buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; within be fed, without be rich no more, so shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men, and death once dead, theres no more dying then . my love is as a fever longing still, for that which longer nurseth the disease, feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, th uncertain sickly appetite to please: my reason the physician to my love, angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me, and i desperate now approve, desire is death, which physic did except . past cure i am, now reason is past care, and franticmad with evermore unrest, my thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are, at random from the truth vainly expressed . for i have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright, who art as black as hell, as dark as night . o me ! what eyes hath love put in my head, which have no correspondence with true sight, or if they have, where is my judgement fled, that censures falsely what they see aright ? if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, what means the world to say it is not so ? if it be not, then love doth well denote, loves eye is not so true as all mens: no, how can it ? o how can loves eye be true, that is so vexed with watching and with tears ? no marvel then though i mistake my view, the sun it self sees not, till heaven clears . o cunning love, with tears thou keepst me blind, lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find . canst thou o cruel, say i love thee not, when i against my self with thee partake ? do i not think on thee when i forgot am of my self, alltyrant, for thy sake ? who hateth thee that i do call my friend, on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon, nay if thou lourst on me do i not spend revenge upon my self with present moan ? what merit do i in my self respect, that is so proud thy service to despise, when all my best doth worship thy defect, commanded by the motion of thine eyes ? but love hate on for now i know thy mind, those that can see thou lovst, and i am blind . o from what power hast thou this powerful might, with insufficiency my heart to sway, to make me give the lie to my true sight, and swear that brightness doth not grace the day ? whence hast thou this becoming of things ill, that in the very refuse of thy deeds, there is such strength and warrantise of skill, that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds ? who taught thee how to make me love thee more, the more i hear and see just cause of hate ? o though i love what others do abhor, with others thou shouldst not abhor my state . if thy unworthiness raised love in me, more worthy i to be beloved of thee . love is too young to know what conscience is, yet who knows not conscience is born of love ? then gentle cheater urge not my amiss, lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove . for thou betraying me, i do betray my nobler part to my gross bodys treason, my soul doth tell my body that he may, triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason, but rising at thy name doth point out thee, as his triumphant prize, proud of this pride, he is contented thy poor drudge to be, to stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side . no want of conscience hold it that i call, her love, for whose dear love i rise and fall . in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn, but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing, in act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn, in vowing new hate after new love bearing: but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee, when i break twenty ? i am perjured most, for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee: and all my honest faith in thee is lost . for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness: oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy, and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness, or made them swear against the thing they see . for i have sworn thee fair: more perjured i, to swear against the truth so foul a lie . cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep, a maid of dians this advantage found, and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valleyfountain of that ground: which borrowed from this holy fire of love, a dateless lively heat still to endure, and grew a seething bath which yet men prove, against strange maladies a sovereign cure: but at my mistress eye loves brand newfired, the boy for trial needs would touch my breast, i sick withal the help of bath desired, and thither hied a sad distempered guest . but found no cure, the bath for my help lies, where cupid got new fire; my mistress eyes . the little lovegod lying once asleep, laid by his side his heartinflaming brand, whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep, came tripping by, but in her maiden hand, the fairest votary took up that fire, which many legions of true hearts had warmed, and so the general of hot desire, was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed . this brand she quenched in a cool well by, which from loves fire took heat perpetual, growing a bath and healthful remedy, for men diseased; but i, my mistress thrall, came there for cure and this by that i prove, loves fire heats water, water cools not love . the end

did he so often lodge in open field, in winters cold and summers parching heat, to conquer france, his true inheritance ? and did my brother bedford toil his wits to keep by policy what henry got ? have you yourselves, somerset, buckingham, brave york, salisbury, and victorious warwick, received deep scars in france and normandy ? or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself, with all the learned council of the realm, studied so long, sat in the council house early and late, debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe, and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes ? and shall these labours and these honours die ? shall henrys conquest, bedfords vigilance, your deeds of war, and all our counsel die ? o peers of england, shameful is this league ! fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame, blotting your names from books of memory, razing the characters of your renown, defacing monuments of conquered france, undoing all, as all had never been ! cardinal . nephew, what means this passionate discourse, this peroration with such circumstance ? for france, tis ours; and we will keep it still . gloucester . ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can, but now it is impossible we should . suffolk, the newmade duke that rules the roast, hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier, whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse . salisbury . now, by the death of him that died for all, these counties were the keys of normandy ! but wherefore weeps warwick, my valiant son ? warwick . for grief that they are past recovery; for, were there hope to conquer them again, my sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears . anjou and maine ! myself did win them both, those provinces these arms of mine did conquer; and are the cities that i got with wounds delivered up again with peaceful words ? mort dieu ! york . for suffolks duke, may he be suffocate, that dims the honour of this warlike isle ! france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league . i never read but englands kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives; and our king henry gives away his own, to match with her that brings no vantages . gloucester . a proper jest, and never heard before, that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her ! she should have staid in france, and starved in france, before cardinal . my lord of gloucester, now ye grow too hot . it was the pleasure of my lord the king . gloucester . my lord of winchester, i know your mind . tis not my speeches that you do mislike, but tis my presence that doth trouble ye . rancour will out . proud prelate, in thy face i see thy fury . if i longer stay, we shall begin our ancient bickerings . lordings, farewell; and say, when i am gone, i prophesied france will be lost ere long . exit . cardinal . so, there goes our protector in a rage . tis known to you he is mine enemy, nay, more, an enemy unto you all, and no great friend, i fear me, to the king . consider, lords, he is the next of blood and heir apparent to the english crown . had henry got an empire by his marriage, and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west, theres reason he should be displeased at it . look to it, lords . let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect . what though the common people favour him, calling him humphrey, the good duke of gloucester, clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice, jesu maintain your royal excellence ! with god preserve the good duke humphrey ! i fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss, he will be found a dangerous protector . buckingham . why should he, then, protect our sovereign, he being of age to govern of himself ?

tis thine they give away, and not their own . pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage, and purchase friends, and give to courtesans, still revelling like lords till all be gone; whileas the silly owner of the goods weeps over them, and wrings his hapless hands, and shakes his head, and trembling stands aloof, while all is shared and all is borne away, ready to starve and dare not touch his own . so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue, while his own lands are bargained for and sold . methinks the realms of england, france, and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnt unto the princes heart of calydon . anjou and maine both given unto the french ! cold news for me, for i had hope of france, even as i have of fertile englands soil . a day will come when york shall claim his own; and therefore i will take the nevilles parts, and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey, and when i spy advantage, claim the crown, for thats the golden mark i seek to hit . nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right, nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist, nor wear the diadem upon his head, whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown . then, york, be still awhile till time do serve . watch thou and wake when others be asleep, to pry into the secrets of the state; till henry, surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and englands dearbought queen, and humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars . then will i raise aloft the milkwhite rose, with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed, and in my standard bear the arms of york, to grapple with the house of lancaster; and force perforce ill make him yield the crown, whose bookish rule hath pulled fair england down . exit . scene ii . the duke of gloucesters house enter duke humphrey of gloucester and his wife eleanor . eleanor . why droops my lord, like overripened corn hanging the head at ceres plenteous load ?

with what a majesty he bears himself, how insolent of late he is become, how proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself ? we know the time since he was mild and affable; and if we did but glance a faroff look, immediately he was upon his knee, that all the court admired him for submission . but meet him now, and be it in the morn when everyone will give the time of day, he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee, disdaining duty that to us belongs . small curs are not regarded when they grin, but great men tremble when the lion roars; and humphrey is no little man in england . first note that he is near you in descent, and should you fall, he is the next will mount . me seemeth then it is no policy, respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease, that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness council . by flattery hath he won the commons hearts; and when he please to make commotion, tis to be feared they all will follow him . now tis the spring, and weeds are shallowrooted; suffer them now, and theyll oergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry . the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke . if it be fond, can it a womans fear; which fear if better reasons can supplant, i will subscribe and say i wronged the duke . my lord of suffolk, buckingham, and york, reprove my allegation if you can, or else conclude my words effectual . suffolk . well hath your highness seen into this duke; and, had i first been put to speak my mind, i think i should have told your graces tale . the duchess by his subornation, upon my life, began her devilish practices; or, if he were not privy to those faults, yet, by reputing of his high descent, as next the king he was successive heir, and such high vaunts of his nobility did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall . smooth runs the water where the brook is deep, and in his simple show he harbours treason . the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb . no, no, my sovereign, gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit . cardinal . did he not, contrary to form of law, devise strange deaths for small offences done ? york . and did he not, in his protectorship, levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france, and never sent it ? by means whereof the towns each day revolted . buckingham . tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown, which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey . king henry . my lords, at once: the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise; but, shall i speak my conscience, our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove . the duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall . queen margaret . ah, whats more dangerous than this fond affiance ? seems he a dove ? his feathers are but borrowed, for hes disposed as the hateful raven . is he a lamb ? his skin is surely lent him, for hes inclined as is the ravenous wolves . who cannot steal a shape that means deceit ?

somerset . that all your interest in those territories is utterly bereft you; all is lost . king henry . cold news, lord somerset; but gods will be done . york . aside . cold news for me, for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england . thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud, and caterpillars eat my leaves away; but i will remedy this gear ere long, or sell my title for a glorious grave . enter gloucester . gloucester . all happiness unto my lord the king ! pardon, my liege, that i have staid so long . suffolk . nay, gloucester, know that thou art come too soon, unless thou wert more loyal than thou art . i do arrest thee of high treason here . gloucester . well, suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush, nor change my countenance for this arrest . a heart unspotted is not easily daunted . the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign . who can accuse me ? wherein am i guilty ? york . tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of france, and, being protector, stayed the soldiers pay, by means whereof his highness hath lost france . gloucester . is it but thought so ? what are they that think it ? i never robbed the soldiers of their pay, nor ever had one penny bribe from france . so help me god, as i have watched the night, ay, night by night, in studying good for england ! that doit that eer i wrested from the king, or any groat i hoarded to my use, be brought against me at my trial day ! no, many a pound of mine own proper store, because i would not tax the needy commons, have i dispursed to the garrisons and never asked for restitution . cardinal . it serves you well, my lord, to say so much . gloucester . i say no more than truth, so help me god ! york . in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of, that england was defamed by tyranny . gloucester . why, tis well known that, whiles i was protector, pity was all the fault that was in me; for i should melt at an offenders tears, and lowly words were ransom for their fault . unless it were a bloody murderer, or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers, i never gave them condign punishment . murder indeed, that bloody sin, i tortured above the felon or what trespass else . suffolk . my lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered; but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself . i do arrest you in his highness name, and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial . king henry . my lord of gloucester, tis my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspense . my conscience tells me you are innocent . gloucester . ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous . virtue is choked with foul ambition, and charity chased hence by rancours hand; foul subornation is predominant, and equity exiled your highness land . i know their complot is to have my life; and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny, i would expend it with all willingness . but mine is made the prologue to their play; for thousands more, that yet suspect no peril, will not conclude their plotted tragedy . beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice, and suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate; sharp buckingham unburdens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart; and dogged york, that reaches at the moon, whose overweening arm i have plucked back, by false accuse doth level at my life . and you, my sovereign lady, with the rest, causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavour have stirred up my liefest liege to be mine enemy . ay, all of you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicles and all to make away my guiltless life . i shall not want false witness to condemn me, nor store of treasons to augment my guilt . the ancient proverb will be well effected: a staff is quickly found to beat a dog . cardinal . my liege, his railing is intolerable . if those that care to keep your royal person from treasons secret knife and traitors rage be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at, and the offender granted scope of speech, twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace . suffolk . hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words, though clerkly couched, as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to oerthrow his state ? queen margaret . but i can give the loser leave to chide . gloucester . far truer spoke than meant . i lose, indeed . beshrew the winners, for they played me false ! and well such losers may have leave to speak . buckingham . hell wrest the sense and hold us here all day . lord cardinal, he is your prisoner . cardinal . sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure . gloucester . ah, thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body . thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side, and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first . ah, that my fear were false; ah, that it were ! for, good king henry, thy decay i fear . exit gloucester, guarded . king henry . my lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best do, or undo, as if ourself were here . queen margaret . what, will your highness leave the parliament ? king henry . ay, margaret; my heart is drowned with grief, whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes, my body round engirt with misery; for whats more miserable than discontent ? ah, uncle humphrey, in thy face i see the map of honour, truth, and loyalty; and yet, good humphrey, is the hour to come that eer i proved thee false or feared thy faith . what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life ? thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong . and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strains, bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse, even so remorseless have they borne him hence; and as the dam runs lowing up and down, looking the way her harmless young one went, and can do naught but wail her darlings loss, even so myself bewails good gloucesters case with sad unhelpful tears, and with dimmed eyes look after him, and cannot do him good, so mighty are his vowed enemies . his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan say whos a traitor ? gloucester he is none . exeunt all but queen, cardinal beaufort, suffolk and york; somerset remains apart . queen margaret . free lords, cold snow melts with the suns hot beams . henry my lord is cold in great affairs, too full of foolish pity; and gloucesters show beguiles him, as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers, or as the snake, rolled in a flowering bank, with shining checkered slough, doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent . believe me, lords, were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world, to rid us from the fear we have of him . cardinal . that he should die is worthy policy, but yet we want a colour for his death . tis meet he be condemned by course of law . suffolk . but, in my mind, that were no policy . the king will labour still to save his life, the commons haply rise to save his life, and yet we have but trivial argument, more than mistrust, that shows him worthy death . york . so that, by this, you would not have him die . suffolk . ah, york, no man alive so fain as i ! york . tis york that hath more reason for his death . but, my lord cardinal, and you, my lord of suffolk, say as you think, and speak it from your souls: were t not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite, as place duke humphrey for the kings protector ? queen margaret . so the poor chicken should be sure of death . suffolk . madam, tis true; and were t not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold, who being accused a crafty murderer, his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed ? no, let him die in that he is a fox, by nature proved an enemy to the flock, before his chaps be stained with crimson blood, as humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege . and do not stand on quillets how to slay him; be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety, sleeping or waking, tis no matter how, so he be dead; for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit . queen margaret . thricenoble suffolk, tis resolutely spoke . suffolk . not resolute, except so much were done, for things are often spoke and seldom meant; but that my heart accordeth with my tongue, seeing the deed is meritorious, and to preserve my sovereign from his foe, say but the word, and i will be his priest . cardinal . but i would have him dead, my lord of suffolk, ere you can take due orders for a priest . say you consent and censure well the deed, and ill provide his executioner . i tender so the safety of my liege . suffolk . here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing . queen margaret . and so say i . york . and i . and now we three have spoke it, it skills not greatly who impugns our doom . enter a post . post . great lords, from ireland am i come amain to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword . send succours, lords, and stop the rage betime, before the wound do grow uncurable; for, being green, there is great hope of help . cardinal . a breach that craves a quick expedient stop ! what counsel give you in this weighty cause ?

although the duke was enemy to him, yet he most christianlike laments his death . and for myself, foe as he was to me, might liquid tears or heartoffending groans or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life, i would be blind with weeping, sick with groans, look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs, and all to have the noble duke alive . what know i how the world may deem of me ?

what boded this, but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpions nest, nor set no footing on this unkind shore ? what did i then, but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards englands blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock ? yet aeolus would not be a murderer, but left that hateful office unto thee . the prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me, knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore with tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness . the splitting rocks cowered in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides, because thy flinty heart, more hard than they, might in thy palace perish margaret . as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs, when from thy shore the tempest beat us back, i stood upon the hatches in the storm, and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnestgaping sight of thy lands view, i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was, bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land . the sea received it, and so i wished thy body might my heart . and even with this i lost fair englands view, and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart, and called them blind and dusky spectacles, for losing ken of albions wished coast . how often have i tempted suffolks tongue, the agent of thy foul inconstancy, to sit and witch me, as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his fathers acts commenced in burning troy ! am i not witched like her ?

enter warwick and others, bearing gloucesters body on a bed . warwick . come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body . king henry . that is to see how deep my grave is made, for with his soul fled all my worldly solace; for seeing him, i see my life in death . warwick . as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his fathers wrathful curse, i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thricefamed duke . suffolk . a dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue ! what instance gives lord warwick for his vow ? warwick . see how the blood is settled in his face . oft have i seen a timelyparted ghost, of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and bloodless, being all descended to the labouring heart, who, in the conflict that it holds with death, attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy, which with the heart there cools and neer returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again . but see, his face is black and full of blood, his eyeballs further out than when he lived, staring full ghastly like a strangled man; his hair upreared, his nostrils stretched with struggling, his hands abroad displayed, as one that grasped and tugged for life and was by strength subdued . look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking; his wellproportioned beard made rough and rugged, like to the summers corn by tempest lodged . it cannot be but he was murdered here; the least of all these signs were probable . suffolk . why, warwick, who should do the duke to death ? myself and beaufort had him in protection, and we, i hope, sir, are no murderers . warwick . but both of you were vowed duke humphreys foes, and you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep . tis like you would not feast him like a friend, and tis well seen he found an enemy . queen margaret . then you, belike, suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphreys timeless death . warwick . who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe, but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter ? who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest but may imagine how the bird was dead, although the kite soar with unbloodied beak ? even so suspicious is this tragedy . queen margaret . are you the butcher, suffolk ? wheres your knife ? is beaufort termed a kite ? where are his talons ? suffolk . i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men, but heres a vengeful sword, rusted with ease, that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murders crimson badge . say, if thou darst, proud lord of warwickshire, that i am faulty in duke humphreys death . exeunt cardinal, somerset and others . warwick . what dares not warwick, if false suffolk dare him ? queen margaret . he dares not calm his contumelious spirit, nor cease to be an arrogant controller, though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times . warwick . madam, be still, with reverence may i say; for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity . suffolk . bluntwitted lord, ignoble in demeanour ! if ever lady wronged her lord so much, thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutored churl, and noble stock was graft with crabtree slip, whose fruit thou art, and never of the nevilles noble race . warwick . but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee, quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames, and that my sovereigns presence makes me mild, i would, false murderous coward, on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech and say it was thy mother that thou meantst, that thou thyself wast born in bastardy; and after all this fearful homage done, give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell, pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men ! suffolk . thou shalt be waking while i shed thy blood, if from this presence thou darst go with me . warwick . away even now, or i will drag thee hence . unworthy though thou art, ill cope with thee and do some service to duke humphreys ghost . exeunt suffolk and warwick . king henry . what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted ?

even at this sight my heart is turned to stone, and while tis mine it shall be stony . york not our old men spares; no more will i their babes; tears virginal shall be to me even as the dew to fire, and beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims, shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax . henceforth i will not have to do with pity . meet i an infant of the house of york, into as many gobbets will i cut it as wild medea young absyrtus did . in cruelty will i seek out my fame . he takes him up on his back . come, thou new ruin of old cliffords house; as did aeneas old anchises bear, so bear i thee upon my manly shoulders; but then aeneas bare a living load, nothing so heavy as these woes of mine . exit, bearing off his father . enter richard and somerset to fight . somerset is killed . richard . so, lie thou there; for underneath an alehouse paltry sign, the castle in saint albans, somerset hath made the wizard famous in his death . sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still ! priests pray for enemies, but princes kill . exit . fight . excursions . enter king, queen and others . queen margaret . away, my lord ! you are slow, for shame, away ! king henry . can we outrun the heavens ?

brutus . no, cassius, for the eye sees not itself but by reflection, by some other thing . cassius . tis just: and it is very much lamented, brutus, that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye, that you might see your shadow . i have heard where many of the best respect in rome, except immortal caesar speaking of brutus, and groaning underneath this ages yoke, have wishd that noble brutus had his eyes . brutus . into what dangers would you lead me, cassius, that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me ? cassius . therefore, good brutus, be prepared to hear; and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection, i, your glass, will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of . and be not jealous on me, gentle brutus: were i a common laugher, or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester; if you know that i do fawn on men, and hug them hard, and after scandal them; or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting, to all the rout, then hold me dangerous . flourish and shout . brutus . what means this shouting ? i do fear the people choose caesar for their king . cassius . ay, do you fear it ? then must i think you would not have it so . brutus . i would not, cassius; yet i love him well, but wherefore do you hold me here so long ? what is it that you would impart to me ? if it be aught toward the general good, set honour in one eye and death i the other, and i will look on both indifferently; for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death . cassius . i know that virtue to be in you, brutus, as well as i do know your outward favour . well, honour is the subject of my story . i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life; but, for my single self, i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself . i was born free as caesar; so were you; we both have fed as well, and we can both endure the winters cold as well as he: for once, upon a raw and gusty day, the troubled tiber chafing with her shores, caesar said to me, darst thou, cassius, now leap in with me into this angry flood, and swim to yonder point ? upon the word, accoutred as i was, i plunged in, and bade him follow: so indeed he did . the torrent roard, and we did buffet it with lusty sinews, throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy . but ere we could arrive the point proposd, caesar cried, help me, cassius, or i sink ! i, as aeneas, our great ancestor, did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear, so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar . and this man is now become a god; and cassius is a wretched creature, and must bend his body, if caesar carelessly but nod on him . he had a fever when he was in spain, and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake: tis true, this god did shake: his coward lips did from their colour fly, and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre . i did hear him groan: ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the romans mark him, and write his speeches in their books, alas, it cried, give me some drink, titinius, as a sick girl . ye gods, it doth amaze me, a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world, and bear the palm alone . shout . flourish . brutus . another general shout ? i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heapd on caesar . cassius . why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus, and we petty men walk under his huge legs, and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves . men at some time are masters of their fates: the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings . brutus and caesar: what should be in that caesar ? why should that name be sounded more than yours ? write them together, yours is as fair a name; sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with em, brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar . now in the names of all the gods at once, upon what meat doth this our caesar feed, that he is grown so great ? age, thou art shamd ! rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods ! when went there by an age since the great flood, but it was famd with more than with one man ? when could they say, till now, that talkd of rome, that her wide walls encompassd but one man ? now is it rome indeed, and room enough, when there is in it but one only man . o, you and i have heard our fathers say, there was a brutus once that would have brookd th eternal devil to keep his state in rome, as easily as a king ! brutus . that you do love me, i am nothing jealous; what you would work me to, i have some aim: how i have thought of this, and of these times, i shall recount hereafter . for this present, i would not, so with love i might entreat you, be any further movd . what you have said, i will consider; what you have to say i will with patience hear; and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things . till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us . cassius . i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus . enter caesar and his train . brutus . the games are done, and caesar is returning . cassius . as they pass by, pluck casca by the sleeve, and he will, after his sour fashion, tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today . brutus . i will do so . but, look you, cassius, the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow, and all the rest look like a chidden train: calphurnias cheek is pale; and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol, being crossd in conference by some senators . cassius . casca will tell us what the matter is . caesar . antonius . antony . caesar ? caesar . let me have men about me that are fat, sleekheaded men, and such as sleep anights: yond cassius has a lean and hungry look; he thinks too much: such men are dangerous . antony . fear him not, caesar; hes not dangerous; he is a noble roman and well given . caesar . would he were fatter ! but i fear him not: yet if my name were liable to fear, i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius . he reads much, he is a great observer, and he looks quite through the deeds of men . he loves no plays, as thou dost, antony; he hears no music . seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit that could be movd to smile at anything . such men as he be never at hearts ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves, and therefore are they very dangerous . i rather tell thee what is to be feard than what i fear; for always i am caesar . come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him . exeunt caesar and his train . casca stays . casca . you pulld me by the cloak; would you speak with me ? brutus . ay, casca, tell us what hath chancd today, that caesar looks so sad . casca . why, you were with him, were you not ? brutus . i should not then ask casca what had chancd . casca . why, there was a crown offerd him; and being offerd him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell ashouting . brutus . what was the second noise for ? casca . why, for that too . cassius . they shouted thrice: what was the last cry for ? casca . why, for that too . brutus . was the crown offerd him thrice ? casca . ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every puttingby mine honest neighbours shouted . cassius . who offerd him the crown ? casca . why, antony . brutus . tell us the manner of it, gentle casca . casca . i can as well be hangd, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery; i did not mark it . i saw mark antony offer him a crown; yet twas not a crown neither, twas one of these coronets; and, as i told you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it . then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it . and then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as he refusd it, the rabblement hooted, and clappd their chopt hands, and threw up their sweaty nightcaps, and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refusd the crown, that it had, almost, choked caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it . and for mine own part, i durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air . cassius . but, soft ! i pray you . what, did caesar swoon ? casca . he fell down in the marketplace, and foamd at mouth, and was speechless . brutus . tis very like: he hath the fallingsickness . cassius . no, caesar hath it not; but you, and i, and honest casca, we have the fallingsickness . casca . i know not what you mean by that; but i am sure caesar fell down . if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, i am no true man . brutus . what said he when he came unto himself ? casca . marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he pluckd me ope his doublet, and offerd them his throat to cut . and i had been a man of any occupation, if i would not have taken him at a word, i would i might go to hell among the rogues . and so he fell . when he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desird their worships to think it was his infirmity . three or four wenches where i stood cried, alas, good soul ! and forgave him with all their hearts . but theres no heed to be taken of them: if caesar had stabbd their mothers, they would have done no less . brutus . and, after that, he came thus sad away ? casca . ay . cassius . did cicero say anything ? casca . ay, he spoke greek . cassius . to what effect ? casca . nay, and i tell you that, ill neer look you i the face again . but those that understood him smild at one another and shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was greek to me . i could tell you more news too: marullus and flavius, for pulling scarfs off caesars images, are put to silence . fare you well . there was more foolery yet, if i could remember it . cassius . will you sup with me tonight, casca ? casca . no, i am promisd forth . cassius . will you dine with me tomorrow ? casca . ay, if i be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating . cassius . good . i will expect you . casca . do so; farewell both . exit casca . brutus . what a blunt fellow is this grown to be ! he was quick mettle when he went to school . cassius . so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise, however he puts on this tardy form . this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite . brutus . and so it is . for this time i will leave you: tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, i will come home to you; or, if you will, come home to me, and i will wait for you . cassius . i will do so: till then, think of the world . exit brutus . well, brutus, thou art noble; yet i see, thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is disposd: therefore tis meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes; for who so firm that cannot be seducd ? caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves brutus . if i were brutus now, and he were cassius, he should not humour me . i will this night, in several hands, in at his windows throw, as if they came from several citizens, writings, all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely caesars ambition shall be glanced at . and after this, let caesar seat him sure, for we will shake him, or worse days endure . exit . scene iii . the same . a street . thunder and lightning . enter, from opposite sides, casca with his sword drawn, and cicero . cicero . good even, casca: brought you caesar home ? why are you breathless, and why stare you so ? casca . are not you moved, when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm ? o cicero, i have seen tempests, when the scolding winds have rivd the knotty oaks; and i have seen th ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam, to be exalted with the threatening clouds: but never till tonight, never till now, did i go through a tempest dropping fire . either there is a civil strife in heaven, or else the world too saucy with the gods, incenses them to send destruction . cicero . why, saw you anything more wonderful ? casca . a common slave, youd know him well by sight, held up his left hand, which did flame and burn like twenty torches joind, and yet his hand, not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd . besides, i ha not since put up my sword, against the capitol i met a lion, who glared upon me, and went surly by, without annoying me . and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, transformed with their fear; who swore they saw men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets . and yesterday the bird of night did sit, even at noonday upon the marketplace, hooting and shrieking . when these prodigies do so conjointly meet, let not men say, these are their reasons; they are natural; for i believe, they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon . cicero . indeed, it is a strangedisposed time . but men may construe things after their fashion, clean from the purpose of the things themselves . comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow ? casca . he doth, for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow . cicero . goodnight then, casca: this disturbed sky is not to walk in . casca . farewell, cicero . exit cicero . enter cassius . cassius . whos there ? casca . a roman . cassius . casca, by your voice . casca . your ear is good . cassius, what night is this ! cassius . a very pleasing night to honest men . casca . who ever knew the heavens menace so ? cassius . those that have known the earth so full of faults . for my part, i have walkd about the streets, submitting me unto the perilous night; and, thus unbraced, casca, as you see, have bard my bosom to the thunderstone; and when the cross blue lightning seemd to open the breast of heaven, i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it . casca . but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ? it is the part of men to fear and tremble, when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us . cassius . you are dull, casca; and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want, or else you use not . you look pale and gaze, and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder, to see the strange impatience of the heavens: but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, why birds and beasts, from quality and kind; why old men, fools, and children calculate, why all these things change from their ordinance, their natures, and preformed faculties, to monstrous quality; why, you shall find that heaven hath infusd them with these spirits, to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state . now could i, casca, name to thee a man most like this dreadful night, that thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars, as doth the lion in the capitol; a man no mightier than thyself, or me, in personal action; yet prodigious grown, and fearful, as these strange eruptions are . casca . tis caesar that you mean; is it not, cassius ? cassius . let it be who it is: for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors; but, woe the while ! our fathers minds are dead, and we are governd with our mothers spirits; our yoke and sufferance show us womanish . casca . indeed, they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king; and he shall wear his crown by sea and land, in every place, save here in italy . cassius . i know where i will wear this dagger then; cassius from bondage will deliver cassius: therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat . nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron, can be retentive to the strength of spirit; but life, being weary of these worldly bars, never lacks power to dismiss itself . if i know this, know all the world besides, that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure . thunder still . casca . so can i: so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity . cassius . and why should caesar be a tyrant then ? poor man ! i know he would not be a wolf, but that he sees the romans are but sheep: he were no lion, were not romans hinds . those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws . what trash is rome, what rubbish, and what offal, when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar ! but, o grief, where hast thou led me ? i, perhaps, speak this before a willing bondman: then i know my answer must be made; but i am armd, and dangers are to me indifferent . casca . you speak to casca, and to such a man that is no fleering telltale . hold, my hand: be factious for redress of all these griefs, and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest . cassius . theres a bargain made . now know you, casca, i have movd already some certain of the noblestminded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honourabledangerous consequence; and i do know by this, they stay for me in pompeys porch: for now, this fearful night, there is no stir or walking in the streets; and the complexion of the element in favours like the work we have in hand, most bloody, fiery, and most terrible . enter cinna . casca . stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste . cassius . tis cinna; i do know him by his gait; he is a friend . cinna, where haste you so ? cinna . to find out you . whos that ? metellus cimber ? cassius . no, it is casca, one incorporate to our attempts . am i not stayd for, cinna ? cinna . i am glad ont . what a fearful night is this ! theres two or three of us have seen strange sights . cassius . am i not stayd for ? tell me . cinna . yes, you are . o cassius, if you could but win the noble brutus to our party cassius . be you content . good cinna, take this paper, and look you lay it in the praetors chair, where brutus may but find it; and throw this in at his window; set this up with wax upon old brutus statue: all this done, repair to pompeys porch, where you shall find us . is decius brutus and trebonius there ? cinna . all but metellus cimber, and hes gone to seek you at your house . well, i will hie, and so bestow these papers as you bade me . cassius . that done, repair to pompeys theatre . exit cinna . come, casca, you and i will yet, ere day, see brutus at his house: three parts of him is ours already, and the man entire upon the next encounter, yields him ours . casca . o, he sits high in all the peoples hearts ! and that which would appear offence in us, his countenance, like richest alchemy, will change to virtue and to worthiness . cassius . him, and his worth, and our great need of him, you have right well conceited . let us go, for it is after midnight; and ere day, we will awake him, and be sure of him . exeunt . act ii scene i . rome . brutus orchard . enter brutus . brutus . what, lucius, ho ! i cannot, by the progress of the stars, give guess how near to day . lucius, i say ! i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly . when, lucius, when ? awake, i say ! what, lucius ! enter lucius . lucius . calld you, my lord ? brutus . get me a taper in my study, lucius: when it is lighted, come and call me here . lucius . i will, my lord . exit . brutus . it must be by his death: and for my part, i know no personal cause to spurn at him, but for the general . he would be crownd: how that might change his nature, theres the question . it is the bright day that brings forth the adder, and that craves wary walking . crown him ? that; and then, i grant, we put a sting in him, that at his will he may do danger with . th abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins remorse from power; and, to speak truth of caesar, i have not known when his affections swayd more than his reason . but tis a common proof, that lowliness is young ambitions ladder, whereto the climberupward turns his face; but when he once attains the upmost round, he then unto the ladder turns his back, looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend . so caesar may; then lest he may, prevent . and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is, fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, would run to these and these extremities: and therefore think him as a serpents egg which hatchd, would, as his kind grow mischievous; and kill him in the shell . enter lucius . lucius . the taper burneth in your closet, sir . searching the window for a flint, i found this paper, thus seald up, and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed . gives him the letter . brutus . get you to bed again; it is not day . is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of march ? lucius . i know not, sir . brutus . look in the calendar, and bring me word . lucius . i will, sir . exit . brutus . the exhalations, whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them . opens the letter and reads . brutus, thou sleepst: awake and see thyself . shall rome, c . speak, strike, redress ! brutus, thou sleepst: awake ! such instigations have been often droppd where i have took them up . shall rome, c . thus must i piece it out: shall rome stand under one mans awe ? what, rome ? my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive, when he was calld a king . speak, strike, redress ! am i entreated to speak and strike ? o rome, i make thee promise, if the redress will follow, thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus . enter lucius . lucius . sir, march is wasted fifteen days . knock within . brutus . tis good . go to the gate, somebody knocks . exit lucius . since cassius first did whet me against caesar, i have not slept . between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion, all the interim is like a phantasma, or a hideous dream: the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council; and the state of man, like to a little kingdom, suffers then the nature of an insurrection . enter lucius . lucius . sir, tis your brother cassius at the door, who doth desire to see you . brutus . is he alone ? lucius . no, sir, there are moe with him . brutus . do you know them ? lucius . no, sir, their hats are pluckd about their ears, and half their faces buried in their cloaks, that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favour . brutus . let em enter . exit lucius . they are the faction . o conspiracy, shamst thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, when evils are most free ? o, then, by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage ? seek none, conspiracy; hide it in smiles and affability: for if thou path, thy native semblance on, not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention . enter cassius, casca, decius, cinna, metellus cimber and trebonius . cassius . i think we are too bold upon your rest: good morrow, brutus; do we trouble you ? brutus . i have been up this hour, awake all night . know i these men that come along with you ? cassius . yes, every man of them; and no man here but honours you; and everyone doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you . this is trebonius . brutus . he is welcome hither . cassius . this decius brutus . brutus . he is welcome too . cassius . this, casca; this, cinna; and this, metellus cimber . brutus . they are all welcome . what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night ? cassius . shall i entreat a word ? they whisper . decius . here lies the east: doth not the day break here ? casca . no . cinna . o, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day . casca . you shall confess that you are both deceivd . here, as i point my sword, the sun arises; which is a great way growing on the south, weighing the youthful season of the year . some two months hence, up higher toward the north he first presents his fire; and the high east stands, as the capitol, directly here . brutus . give me your hands all over, one by one . cassius . and let us swear our resolution . brutus . no, not an oath . if not the face of men, the sufferance of our souls, the times abuse if these be motives weak, break off betimes, and every man hence to his idle bed . so let highsighted tyranny range on, till each man drop by lottery . but if these, as i am sure they do, bear fire enough to kindle cowards, and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women; then, countrymen, what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress ? what other bond than secret romans, that have spoke the word, and will not palter ? and what other oath than honesty to honesty engagd, that this shall be, or we will fall for it ? swear priests and cowards, and men cautelous, old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise, nor th insuppressive mettle of our spirits, to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath; when every drop of blood that every roman bears, and nobly bears, is guilty of a several bastardy, if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passd from him . cassius . but what of cicero ? shall we sound him ? i think he will stand very strong with us . casca . let us not leave him out . cinna . no, by no means . metellus . o, let us have him, for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion, and buy mens voices to commend our deeds . it shall be said, his judgement ruld our hands; our youths and wildness shall no whit appear, but all be buried in his gravity . brutus . o, name him not; let us not break with him; for he will never follow anything that other men begin . cassius . then leave him out . casca . indeed, he is not fit . decius . shall no man else be touchd but only caesar ? cassius . decius, well urgd . i think it is not meet, mark antony, so well belovd of caesar, should outlive caesar: we shall find of him a shrewd contriver; and you know, his means, if he improve them, may well stretch so far as to annoy us all; which to prevent, let antony and caesar fall together . brutus . our course will seem too bloody, caius cassius, to cut the head off, and then hack the limbs, like wrath in death, and envy afterwards; for antony is but a limb of caesar . let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, caius . we all stand up against the spirit of caesar, and in the spirit of men there is no blood . o, that we then could come by caesars spirit, and not dismember caesar ! but, alas, caesar must bleed for it ! and, gentle friends, lets kill him boldly, but not wrathfully; lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods, not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds . and let our hearts, as subtle masters do, stir up their servants to an act of rage, and after seem to chide em . this shall mark our purpose necessary, and not envious; which so appearing to the common eyes, we shall be calld purgers, not murderers . and for mark antony, think not of him; for he can do no more than caesars arm when caesars head is off . cassius . yet i fear him; for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar brutus . alas, good cassius, do not think of him: if he love caesar, all that he can do is to himself; take thought and die for caesar . and that were much he should; for he is given to sports, to wildness, and much company . trebonius . there is no fear in him; let him not die; for he will live, and laugh at this hereafter . clock strikes . brutus . peace ! count the clock . cassius . the clock hath stricken three . trebonius . tis time to part . cassius . but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no; for he is superstitious grown of late, quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies . it may be these apparent prodigies, the unaccustomd terror of this night, and the persuasion of his augurers, may hold him from the capitol today . decius . never fear that: if he be so resolved, i can oersway him, for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betrayd with trees, and bears with glasses, elephants with holes, lions with toils, and men with flatterers . but when i tell him he hates flatterers, he says he does, being then most flattered . let me work; for i can give his humour the true bent, and i will bring him to the capitol . cassius . nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him . brutus . by the eighth hour: is that the uttermost ? cinna . be that the uttermost; and fail not then . metellus . caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard, who rated him for speaking well of pompey; i wonder none of you have thought of him . brutus . now, good metellus, go along by him: he loves me well, and i have given him reason; send him but hither, and ill fashion him . cassius . the morning comes upons . well leave you, brutus . and, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember what you have said, and show yourselves true romans . brutus . good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily; let not our looks put on our purposes, but bear it as our roman actors do, with untired spirits and formal constancy . and so, good morrow to you everyone . exeunt all but brutus . boy ! lucius ! fast asleep ? it is no matter; enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber: thou hast no figures nor no fantasies, which busy care draws in the brains of men; therefore thou sleepst so sound . enter portia . portia . brutus, my lord . brutus . portia, what mean you ? wherefore rise you now ? it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning . portia . nor for yours neither . y have ungently, brutus, stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper, you suddenly arose, and walkd about, musing and sighing, with your arms across; and when i askd you what the matter was, you stard upon me with ungentle looks . i urgd you further; then you scratchd your head, and too impatiently stampd with your foot; yet i insisted, yet you answerd not, but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you . so i did, fearing to strengthen that impatience which seemd too much enkindled; and withal hoping it was but an effect of humour, which sometime hath his hour with every man . it will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep; and could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevaild on your condition, i should not know you, brutus . dear my lord, make me acquainted with your cause of grief . brutus . i am not well in health, and that is all . portia . brutus is wise, and, were he not in health, he would embrace the means to come by it . brutus . why, so i do . good portia, go to bed . portia . is brutus sick, and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humours of the dank morning ? what, is brutus sick, and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night, and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness ? no, my brutus; you have some sick offence within your mind, which, by the right and virtue of my place, i ought to know of: and, upon my knees, i charm you, by my once commended beauty, by all your vows of love, and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one, that you unfold to me, your self, your half, why you are heavy, and what men tonight have had resort to you; for here have been some six or seven, who did hide their faces even from darkness . brutus . kneel not, gentle portia . portia . i should not need, if you were gentle brutus . within the bond of marriage, tell me, brutus, is it excepted i should know no secrets that appertain to you ? am i your self but, as it were, in sort or limitation, to keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, and talk to you sometimes ? dwell i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure ? if it be no more, portia is brutus harlot, not his wife . brutus . you are my true and honourable wife, as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart . portia . if this were true, then should i know this secret . i grant i am a woman; but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife; i grant i am a woman; but withal a woman well reputed, catos daughter . think you i am no stronger than my sex, being so fatherd and so husbanded ? tell me your counsels, i will not disclose em . i have made strong proof of my constancy, giving myself a voluntary wound here, in the thigh: can i bear that with patience and not my husbands secrets ? brutus . o ye gods, render me worthy of this noble wife ! knock . hark, hark, one knocks . portia, go in awhile; and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart . all my engagements i will construe to thee, all the charactery of my sad brows . leave me with haste . exit portia . enter lucius with ligarius . lucius, whos that knocks ? lucius . here is a sick man that would speak with you . brutus . caius ligarius, that metellus spake of . boy, stand aside . caius ligarius, how ? ligarius . vouchsafe goodmorrow from a feeble tongue . brutus . o, what a time have you chose out, brave caius, to wear a kerchief ! would you were not sick ! ligarius . i am not sick, if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honour . brutus . such an exploit have i in hand, ligarius, had you a healthful ear to hear of it . ligarius . by all the gods that romans bow before, i here discard my sickness . soul of rome ! brave son, derived from honourable loins ! thou, like an exorcist, hast conjurd up my mortified spirit . now bid me run, and i will strive with things impossible, yea, get the better of them . whats to do ? brutus . a piece of work that will make sick men whole . ligarius . but are not some whole that we must make sick ? brutus . that must we also . what it is, my caius, i shall unfold to thee, as we are going, to whom it must be done . ligarius . set on your foot, and with a heart newfird i follow you, to do i know not what; but it sufficeth that brutus leads me on . thunder . brutus . follow me then . exeunt . scene ii . a room in caesars palace . thunder and lightning . enter caesar, in his nightgown . caesar . nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight: thrice hath calphurnia in her sleep cried out, help, ho ! they murder caesar ! whos within ? enter a servant . servant . my lord ? caesar . go bid the priests do present sacrifice, and bring me their opinions of success . servant . i will, my lord . exit . enter calphurnia . calphurnia . what mean you, caesar ? think you to walk forth ? you shall not stir out of your house today . caesar . caesar shall forth . the things that threatend me neer lookd but on my back; when they shall see the face of caesar, they are vanished . calphurnia . caesar, i never stood on ceremonies, yet now they fright me . there is one within, besides the things that we have heard and seen, recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch . a lioness hath whelped in the streets, and graves have yawnd, and yielded up their dead; fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war, which drizzled blood upon the capitol; the noise of battle hurtled in the air, horses did neigh, and dying men did groan, and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets . o caesar, these things are beyond all use, and i do fear them ! caesar . what can be avoided whose end is purposd by the mighty gods ? yet caesar shall go forth; for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar . calphurnia . when beggars die, there are no comets seen; the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes . caesar . cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once . of all the wonders that i yet have heard, it seems to me most strange that men should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come . enter servant . what say the augurers ? servant . they would not have you to stir forth today . plucking the entrails of an offering forth, they could not find a heart within the beast . caesar . the gods do this in shame of cowardice: caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear . no, caesar shall not . danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he . we are two lions litterd in one day, and i the elder and more terrible, and caesar shall go forth . calphurnia . alas, my lord, your wisdom is consumd in confidence . do not go forth today: call it my fear that keeps you in the house, and not your own . well send mark antony to the senatehouse, and he shall say you are not well today . let me upon my knee prevail in this . caesar . mark antony shall say i am not well, and for thy humour, i will stay at home . enter decius . heres decius brutus, he shall tell them so . decius . caesar, all hail ! good morrow, worthy caesar . i come to fetch you to the senatehouse . caesar . and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators, and tell them that i will not come today . cannot, is false; and that i dare not, falser: i will not come today . tell them so, decius . calphurnia . say he is sick . caesar . shall caesar send a lie ? have i in conquest stretchd mine arm so far, to be afeard to tell greybeards the truth ? decius, go tell them caesar will not come . decius . most mighty caesar, let me know some cause, lest i be laughd at when i tell them so . caesar . the cause is in my will; i will not come . that is enough to satisfy the senate . but for your private satisfaction, because i love you, i will let you know: calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home . she dreamt tonight she saw my statue, which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood; and many lusty romans came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it . and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent; and on her knee hath beggd that i will stay at home today . decius . this dream is all amiss interpreted: it was a vision fair and fortunate . your statue spouting blood in many pipes, in which so many smiling romans bathd, signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood, and that great men shall press for tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance . this by calphurnias dream is signified . caesar . and this way have you well expounded it . decius . i have, when you have heard what i can say; and know it now . the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar . if you shall send them word you will not come, their minds may change . besides, it were a mock apt to be renderd, for someone to say, break up the senate till another time, when caesars wife shall meet with better dreams . if caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper lo, caesar is afraid ? pardon me, caesar; for my dear dear love to your proceeding bids me tell you this, and reason to my love is liable . caesar . how foolish do your fears seem now, calphurnia ! i am ashamed i did yield to them . give me my robe, for i will go . enter brutus, ligarius, metellus, casca, trebonius, cinna and publius . and look where publius is come to fetch me . publius . good morrow, caesar . caesar . welcome, publius . what, brutus, are you stirrd so early too ?

metellus . most high, most mighty, and most puissant caesar, metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart . kneeling . caesar . i must prevent thee, cimber . these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men, and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children . be not fond, to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thawd from the true quality with that which melteth fools; i mean sweet words, lowcrooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning . thy brother by decree is banished: if thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him, i spurn thee like a cur out of my way . know, caesar dost not wrong, nor without cause will he be satisfied . metellus . is there no voice more worthy than my own, to sound more sweetly in great caesars ear for the repealing of my banishd brother ? brutus . i kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, caesar; desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal . caesar . what, brutus ? cassius . pardon, caesar; caesar, pardon: as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall, to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber . caesar . i could be well movd, if i were as you; if i could pray to move, prayers would move me: but i am constant as the northern star, of whose truefixd and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament . the skies are painted with unnumberd sparks, they are all fire, and every one doth shine; but theres but one in all doth hold his place . so in the world; tis furnishd well with men, and men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive; yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank, unshakd of motion: and that i am he, let me a little show it, even in this, that i was constant cimber should be banishd, and constant do remain to keep him so . cinna . o caesar, caesar . hence ! wilt thou lift up olympus ? decius . great caesar, caesar . doth not brutus bootless kneel ? casca . speak, hands, for me ! casca stabs caesar in the neck . caesar catches hold of his arm . he is then stabbed by several other conspirators, and at last by marcus brutus . caesar . et tu, brute ?

cassius . ay, every man away . brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome . enter a servant . brutus . soft, who comes here ? a friend of antonys . servant . thus, brutus, did my master bid me kneel; thus did mark antony bid me fall down; and, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving; say i love brutus and i honour him; say i feard caesar, honourd him, and lovd him . if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him, and be resolvd how caesar hath deservd to lie in death, mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living; but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state, with all true faith . so says my master antony . brutus . thy master is a wise and valiant roman; i never thought him worse . tell him, so please him come unto this place, he shall be satisfied and, by my honour, depart untouchd . servant . ill fetch him presently . exit . brutus . i know that we shall have him well to friend . cassius . i wish we may: but yet have i a mind that fears him much; and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose . enter antony . brutus . but here comes antony . welcome, mark antony . antony . o mighty caesar ! dost thou lie so low ? are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, shrunk to this little measure ? fare thee well . i know not, gentlemen, what you intend, who else must be let blood, who else is rank: if i myself, there is no hour so fit as caesars deaths hour; nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords, made rich with the most noble blood of all this world . i do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, fulfill your pleasure . live a thousand years, i shall not find myself so apt to die . no place will please me so, no means of death, as here by caesar, and by you cut off, the choice and master spirits of this age . brutus . o antony, beg not your death of us . though now we must appear bloody and cruel, as by our hands and this our present act you see we do; yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done . our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire, so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar . for your part, to you our swords have leaden points, mark antony; our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts of brothers temper, do receive you in with all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence . cassius . your voice shall be as strong as any mans in the disposing of new dignities . brutus . only be patient till we have appeasd the multitude, beside themselves with fear, and then we will deliver you the cause why i, that did love caesar when i struck him, have thus proceeded . antony . i doubt not of your wisdom . let each man render me his bloody hand . first, marcus brutus, will i shake with you; next, caius cassius, do i take your hand . now, decius brutus, yours; now yours, metellus; yours, cinna; and, my valiant casca, yours; though last, not least in love, yours, good trebonius . gentlemen allalas, what shall i say ? my credit now stands on such slippery ground, that one of two bad ways you must conceit me, either a coward or a flatterer . that i did love thee, caesar, o, tis true: if then thy spirit look upon us now, shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death, to see thy antony making his peace, shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, most noble, in the presence of thy corse ? had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds, weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies . pardon me, julius ! here wast thou bayd, brave hart; here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand, signd in thy spoil, and crimsond in thy lethe . o world, thou wast the forest to this hart; and this indeed, o world, the heart of thee . how like a deer strucken by many princes, dost thou here lie ! cassius . mark antony, antony . pardon me, caius cassius: the enemies of caesar shall say this; then, in a friend, it is cold modesty . cassius . i blame you not for praising caesar so; but what compact mean you to have with us ? will you be prickd in number of our friends, or shall we on, and not depend on you ? antony . therefore i took your hands; but was indeed swayd from the point, by looking down on caesar . friends am i with you all, and love you all, upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons why, and wherein, caesar was dangerous . brutus . or else were this a savage spectacle . our reasons are so full of good regard that were you, antony, the son of caesar, you should be satisfied . antony . thats all i seek, and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace; and in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, speak in the order of his funeral . brutus . you shall, mark antony . cassius . brutus, a word with you . aside to brutus . you know not what you do . do not consent that antony speak in his funeral . know you how much the people may be movd by that which he will utter ? brutus . aside to cassius . by your pardon: i will myself into the pulpit first, and show the reason of our caesars death . what antony shall speak, i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission; and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rights and lawful ceremonies . it shall advantage more than do us wrong . cassius . aside to brutus . i know not what may fall; i like it not . brutus . mark antony, here, take you caesars body . you shall not in your funeral speech blame us, but speak all good you can devise of caesar, and say you dot by our permission; else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral . and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going, after my speech is ended . antony . be it so; i do desire no more . brutus . prepare the body, then, and follow us . exeunt all but antony . antony . o, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, that i am meek and gentle with these butchers . thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times . woe to the hand that shed this costly blood ! over thy wounds now do i prophesy, which, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue, a curse shall light upon the limbs of men; domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy; blood and destruction shall be so in use, and dreadful objects so familiar, that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quartered with the hands of war; all pity chokd with custom of fell deeds: and caesars spirit, ranging for revenge, with ate by his side come hot from hell, shall in these confines with a monarchs voice cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war, that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men, groaning for burial . enter a servant . you serve octavius caesar, do you not ? servant . i do, mark antony . antony . caesar did write for him to come to rome . servant . he did receive his letters, and is coming, and bid me say to you by word of mouth, seeing the body . o caesar ! antony . thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep . passion, i see, is catching; for mine eyes, seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, began to water . is thy master coming ? servant . he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome . antony . post back with speed, and tell him what hath chancd . here is a mourning rome, a dangerous rome, no rome of safety for octavius yet . hie hence, and tell him so . yet stay awhile; thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the marketplace: there shall i try, in my oration, how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men; according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things . lend me your hand . exeunt with caesars body . scene ii . the same . the forum . enter brutus and goes into the pulpit, and cassius, with a throng of citizens . citizens . we will be satisfied; let us be satisfied . brutus . then follow me, and give me audience, friends . cassius, go you into the other street and part the numbers . those that will hear me speak, let em stay here; those that will follow cassius, go with him; and public reasons shall be rendered of caesars death . first citizen . i will hear brutus speak . second citizen . i will hear cassius; and compare their reasons, when severally we hear them rendered . exit cassius, with some of the citizens . brutus goes into the rostrum . third citizen . the noble brutus is ascended: silence ! brutus . be patient till the last . romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause; and be silent, that you may hear . believe me for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that you may believe . censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge . if there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of caesars, to him i say that brutus love to caesar was no less than his . if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar, this is my answer: not that i loved caesar less, but that i loved rome more . had you rather caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that caesar were dead, to live all free men ? as caesar loved me, i weep for him; as he was fortunate, i rejoice at it; as he was valiant, i honour him; but, as he was ambitious, i slew him . there is tears, for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his valour; and death, for his ambition . who is here so base, that would be a bondman ? if any, speak; for him have i offended . who is here so rude, that would not be a roman ? if any, speak; for him have i offended . who is here so vile, that will not love his country ? if any, speak; for him have i offended . i pause for a reply . citizens . none, brutus, none . brutus . then none have i offended . i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus . the question of his death is enrolld in the capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforcd, for which he suffered death . enter antony and others, with caesars body . here comes his body, mourned by mark antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as which of you shall not ? with this i depart, that, as i slew my best lover for the good of rome, i have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death . citizens . live, brutus ! live, live ! first citizen . bring him with triumph home unto his house . second citizen . give him a statue with his ancestors . third citizen . let him be caesar . fourth citizen . caesars better parts shall be crownd in brutus . first citizen . well bring him to his house with shouts and clamours . brutus . my countrymen, second citizen . peace ! silence ! brutus speaks . first citizen . peace, ho ! brutus . good countrymen, let me depart alone, and, for my sake, stay here with antony . do grace to caesars corpse, and grace his speech tending to caesars glories, which mark antony, by our permission, is allowd to make . i do entreat you, not a man depart, save i alone, till antony have spoke . exit . first citizen . stay, ho ! and let us hear mark antony . third citizen . let him go up into the public chair . well hear him . noble antony, go up . antony . for brutus sake, i am beholding to you . goes up . fourth citizen . what does he say of brutus ? third citizen . he says, for brutus sake he finds himself beholding to us all . fourth citizen . twere best he speak no harm of brutus here ! first citizen . this caesar was a tyrant . third citizen . nay, thats certain . we are blest that rome is rid of him . second citizen . peace ! let us hear what antony can say . antony . you gentle romans, citizens . peace, ho ! let us hear him . antony . friends, romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; i come to bury caesar, not to praise him . the evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones; so let it be with caesar . the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious . if it were so, it was a grievous fault, and grievously hath caesar answerd it . here, under leave of brutus and the rest, for brutus is an honourable man, so are they all, all honourable men, come i to speak in caesars funeral . he was my friend, faithful and just to me; but brutus says he was ambitious, and brutus is an honourable man . he hath brought many captives home to rome, whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: did this in caesar seem ambitious ? when that the poor have cried, caesar hath wept; ambition should be made of sterner stuff: yet brutus says he was ambitious; and brutus is an honourable man . you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown, which he did thrice refuse . was this ambition ? yet brutus says he was ambitious; and sure he is an honourable man . i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke, but here i am to speak what i do know . you all did love him once, not without cause; what cause withholds you then to mourn for him ? o judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason . bear with me . my heart is in the coffin there with caesar, and i must pause till it come back to me . first citizen . methinks there is much reason in his sayings . second citizen . if thou consider rightly of the matter, caesar has had great wrong . third citizen . has he, masters ? i fear there will a worse come in his place . fourth citizen . markd ye his words ? he would not take the crown; therefore tis certain he was not ambitious . first citizen . if it be found so, some will dear abide it . second citizen . poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping . third citizen . theres not a nobler man in rome than antony . fourth citizen . now mark him; he begins again to speak . antony . but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world; now lies he there, and none so poor to do him reverence . o masters ! if i were disposd to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong, who, you all know, are honourable men . i will not do them wrong; i rather choose to wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, than i will wrong such honourable men . but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar, i found it in his closet; tis his will: let but the commons hear this testament, which, pardon me, i do not mean to read, and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds, and dip their napkins in his sacred blood; yea, beg a hair of him for memory, and, dying, mention it within their wills, bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue . fourth citizen . well hear the will . read it, mark antony . citizens . the will, the will ! we will hear caesars will . antony . have patience, gentle friends, i must not read it . it is not meet you know how caesar loved you . you are not wood, you are not stones, but men; and being men, hearing the will of caesar, it will inflame you, it will make you mad . tis good you know not that you are his heirs; for if you should, o, what would come of it ?

what villain touchd his body, that did stab, and not for justice ? what ! shall one of us, that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers, shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes, and sell the mighty space of our large honours for so much trash as may be grasped thus ?

ay, more: fret till your proud heart break; go show your slaves how choleric you are, and make your bondmen tremble . must i budge ? must i observe you ? must i stand and crouch under your testy humour ? by the gods, you shall digest the venom of your spleen, though it do split you; for, from this day forth, ill use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, when you are waspish . cassius . is it come to this ? brutus . you say you are a better soldier: let it appear so; make your vaunting true, and it shall please me well . for mine own part, i shall be glad to learn of noble men . cassius . you wrong me every way, you wrong me, brutus . i said, an elder soldier, not a better: did i say better ?

should i have answerd caius cassius so ? when marcus brutus grows so covetous, to lock such rascal counters from his friends, be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts, dash him to pieces ! cassius . i denied you not . brutus . you did . cassius . i did not . he was but a fool that brought my answer back . brutus hath rivd my heart . a friend should bear his friends infirmities; but brutus makes mine greater than they are . brutus . i do not, till you practise them on me . cassius . you love me not . brutus . i do not like your faults . cassius . a friendly eye could never see such faults . brutus . a flatterers would not, though they do appear as huge as high olympus . cassius . come, antony, and young octavius, come, revenge yourselves alone on cassius, for cassius is aweary of the world: hated by one he loves; bravd by his brother; checkd like a bondman; all his faults observd, set in a notebook, learnd and connd by rote, to cast into my teeth . o, i could weep my spirit from mine eyes ! there is my dagger, and here my naked breast; within, a heart dearer than plutus mine, richer than gold: if that thou best a roman, take it forth . i, that denied thee gold, will give my heart: strike as thou didst at caesar; for i know, when thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius . brutus . sheathe your dagger . be angry when you will, it shall have scope; do what you will, dishonour shall be humour . o cassius, you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire, who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark, and straight is cold again . cassius . hath cassius livd to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus, when grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him ? brutus . when i spoke that, i was illtemperd too . cassius . do you confess so much ? give me your hand . brutus . and my heart too . cassius . o brutus ! brutus . whats the matter ? cassius . have not you love enough to bear with me, when that rash humour which my mother gave me makes me forgetful ?

portia ? brutus . she is dead . cassius . how scapd i killing, when i crossd you so ? o insupportable and touching loss ! upon what sickness ? brutus . impatient of my absence, and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong; for with her death that tidings came . with this she fell distract, and, her attendants absent, swallowd fire . cassius . and died so ?

brutus . no, messala . messala . nor nothing in your letters writ of her ? brutus . nothing, messala . messala . that, methinks, is strange . brutus . why ask you ? hear you aught of her in yours ? messala . no, my lord . brutus . now as you are a roman, tell me true . messala . then like a roman bear the truth i tell, for certain she is dead, and by strange manner . brutus . why, farewell, portia . we must die, messala . with meditating that she must die once, i have the patience to endure it now . messala . even so great men great losses should endure . cassius . i have as much of this in art as you, but yet my nature could not bear it so . brutus . well, to our work alive . what do you think of marching to philippi presently ? cassius . i do not think it good . brutus . your reason ? cassius . this it is: tis better that the enemy seek us; so shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, doing himself offence, whilst we, lying still, are full of rest, defence, and nimbleness . brutus . good reasons must of force give place to better . the people twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection; for they have grudgd us contribution . the enemy, marching along by them, by them shall make a fuller number up, come on refreshd, newadded, and encouragd; from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there, these people at our back . cassius . hear me, good brother . brutus . under your pardon . you must note besides, that we have tried the utmost of our friends, our legions are brimfull, our cause is ripe . the enemy increaseth every day; we, at the height, are ready to decline . there is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries . on such a full sea are we now afloat, and we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures . cassius . then, with your will, go on: well along ourselves, and meet them at philippi . brutus . the deep of night is crept upon our talk, and nature must obey necessity, which we will niggard with a little rest . there is no more to say ?

octavius . i do not cross you; but i will do so . march . drum . enter brutus, cassius and their army; lucilius, titinius, messala and others . brutus . they stand, and would have parley . cassius . stand fast, titinius; we must out and talk . octavius . mark antony, shall we give sign of battle ? antony . no, caesar, we will answer on their charge . make forth; the generals would have some words . octavius . stir not until the signal . brutus . words before blows: is it so, countrymen ? octavius . not that we love words better, as you do . brutus . good words are better than bad strokes, octavius . antony . in your bad strokes, brutus, you give good words; witness the hole you made in caesars heart, crying, long live ! hail, caesar ! cassius . antony, the posture of your blows are yet unknown; but for your words, they rob the hybla bees, and leave them honeyless . antony . not stingless too . brutus . o yes, and soundless too, for you have stoln their buzzing, antony, and very wisely threat before you sting . antony . villains, you did not so when your vile daggers hackd one another in the sides of caesar: you showd your teeth like apes, and fawnd like hounds, and bowd like bondmen, kissing caesars feet; whilst damned casca, like a cur, behind struck caesar on the neck . o you flatterers ! cassius . flatterers ! now, brutus, thank yourself . this tongue had not offended so today, if cassius might have ruld . octavius . come, come, the cause . if arguing makes us sweat, the proof of it will turn to redder drops . look, i draw a sword against conspirators . when think you that the sword goes up again ? never, till caesars three and thirty wounds be well avengd; or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors . brutus . caesar, thou canst not die by traitors hands, unless thou bringst them with thee . octavius . so i hope . i was not born to die on brutus sword . brutus . o, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, young man, thou couldst not die more honourable . cassius . a peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour, joind with a masker and a reveller . antony . old cassius still ! octavius . come, antony; away ! defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth . if you dare fight today, come to the field; if not, when you have stomachs . exeunt octavius, antony and their army . cassius . why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark ! the storm is up, and all is on the hazard . brutus . ho, lucilius ! hark, a word with you . lucilius . my lord ?

brutus . even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself, i know not how, but i do find it cowardly and vile, for fear of what might fall, so to prevent the time of life, arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below . cassius . then, if we lose this battle, you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome ? brutus . no, cassius, no: think not, thou noble roman, that ever brutus will go bound to rome; he bears too great a mind . but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun; and whether we shall meet again i know not . therefore our everlasting farewell take . for ever, and for ever, farewell, cassius . if we do meet again, why, we shall smile; if not, why then this parting was well made . cassius . for ever and for ever farewell, brutus . if we do meet again, well smile indeed; if not, tis true this parting was well made . brutus . why then, lead on . o, that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come ! but it sufficeth that the day will end, and then the end is known . come, ho ! away ! exeunt . scene ii . the same . the field of battle . alarum . enter brutus and messala . brutus . ride, ride, messala, ride, and give these bills unto the legions on the other side . loud alarum . let them set on at once; for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius wing, and sudden push gives them the overthrow . ride, ride, messala; let them all come down . exeunt . scene iii . another part of the field . alarum . enter cassius and titinius . cassius . o, look, titinius, look, the villains fly ! myself have to mine own turnd enemy: this ensign here of mine was turning back; i slew the coward, and did take it from him . titinius . o cassius, brutus gave the word too early, who, having some advantage on octavius, took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil, whilst we by antony are all enclosd . enter pindarus . pindarus . fly further off, my lord, fly further off; mark antony is in your tents, my lord . fly, therefore, noble cassius, fly far off . cassius . this hill is far enough . look, look, titinius; are those my tents where i perceive the fire ? titinius . they are, my lord . cassius . titinius, if thou lovest me, mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him, till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again, that i may rest assurd whether yond troops are friend or enemy . titinius . i will be here again, even with a thought . exit . cassius . go, pindarus, get higher on that hill, my sight was ever thick . regard titinius, and tell me what thou notest about the field . pindarus goes up . this day i breathed first . time is come round, and where i did begin, there shall i end . my life is run his compass . sirrah, what news ? pindarus . above . o my lord ! cassius . what news ? pindarus . above . titinius is enclosed round about with horsemen, that make to him on the spur, yet he spurs on . now they are almost on him . now, titinius ! now some light . o, he lights too . hes taen ! shout . and, hark ! they shout for joy . cassius . come down; behold no more . o, coward that i am, to live so long, to see my best friend taen before my face ! pindarus descends . come hither, sirrah . in parthia did i take thee prisoner; and then i swore thee, saving of thy life, that whatsoever i did bid thee do, thou shouldst attempt it . come now, keep thine oath . now be a freeman; and with this good sword, that ran through caesars bowels, search this bosom . stand not to answer . here, take thou the hilts; and when my face is coverd, as tis now, guide thou the sword . caesar, thou art revengd, even with the sword that killd thee . dies . pindarus . so, i am free, yet would not so have been, durst i have done my will . o cassius ! far from this country pindarus shall run, where never roman shall take note of him . exit . enter titinius with messala . messala . it is but change, titinius; for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus power, as cassius legions are by antony . titinius . these tidings would well comfort cassius . messala . where did you leave him ? titinius . all disconsolate, with pindarus his bondman, on this hill . messala . is not that he that lies upon the ground ? titinius . he lies not like the living . o my heart ! messala . is not that he ? titinius . no, this was he, messala, but cassius is no more . o setting sun, as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night, so in his red blood cassius day is set . the sun of rome is set . our day is gone; clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done . mistrust of my success hath done this deed . messala . mistrust of good success hath done this deed . o hateful error, melancholys child ! why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men the things that are not ? o error, soon conceivd, thou never comst unto a happy birth, but killst the mother that engenderd thee ! titinius . what, pindarus ! where art thou, pindarus ? messala . seek him, titinius, whilst i go to meet the noble brutus, thrusting this report into his ears . i may say thrusting it; for piercing steel and darts envenomed shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus as tidings of this sight . titinius . hie you, messala, and i will seek for pindarus the while . exit messala . why didst thou send me forth, brave cassius ? did i not meet thy friends ? and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory, and bid me give it thee ? didst thou not hear their shouts ? alas, thou hast misconstrued everything ! but, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow; thy brutus bid me give it thee, and i will do his bidding . brutus, come apace, and see how i regarded caius cassius . by your leave, gods . this is a romans part . come, cassius sword, and find titinius heart . dies . alarum . enter brutus, messala, young cato, strato, volumnius and lucilius . brutus . where, where, messala, doth his body lie ?

the last of all the romans, fare thee well ! it is impossible that ever rome should breed thy fellow . friends, i owe more tears to this dead man than you shall see me pay . i shall find time, cassius, i shall find time . come therefore, and to thassos send his body . his funerals shall not be in our camp, lest it discomfort us . lucilius, come; and come, young cato; let us to the field . labeo and flavius, set our battles on . tis three oclock; and romans, yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight . exeunt . scene iv . another part of the field . alarum . enter fighting soldiers of both armies; then brutus, messala, young cato, lucilius, flavius and others . brutus . yet, countrymen, o, yet hold up your heads ! cato . what bastard doth not ?

whence comes this restraint ? claudio . from too much liberty, my lucio, liberty . as surfeit is the father of much fast, so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint . our natures do pursue, like rats that ravin down their proper bane, a thirsty evil; and when we drink, we die . lucio . if i could speak so wisely under an arrest, i would send for certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment . whats thy offence, claudio ? claudio . what but to speak of would offend again . lucio . what, ist murder ? claudio . no . lucio . lechery ? claudio . call it so . provost . away, sir; you must go . claudio . one word, good friend . lucio, a word with you . lucio . a hundred, if theyll do you any good . is lechery so looked after ? claudio . thus stands it with me: upon a true contract i got possession of juliettas bed . you know the lady; she is fast my wife, save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order . this we came not to only for propagation of a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends, from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us . but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet . lucio . with child, perhaps ? claudio . unhappily, even so . and the new deputy now for the duke whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride, who, newly in the seat, that it may know he can command, lets it straight feel the spur; whether the tyranny be in his place, or in his eminence that fills it up, i stagger inbut this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have, like unscoured armour, hung by th wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round, and none of them been worn; and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me . tis surely for a name . lucio . i warrant it is . and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off . send after the duke, and appeal to him . claudio . i have done so, but hes not to be found . i prithee, lucio, do me this kind service: this day my sister should the cloister enter, and there receive her approbation . acquaint her with the danger of my state; implore her, in my voice, that she make friends to the strict deputy; bid herself assay him . i have great hope in that . for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as moves men; beside, she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse, and well she can persuade . lucio . i pray she may, as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of ticktack . ill to her . claudio . i thank you, good friend lucio . lucio . within two hours . claudio . come, officer, away . exeunt . scene iii . a monastery . enter duke and friar thomas . duke . no, holy father, throw away that thought; believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom . why i desire thee to give me secret harbour hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth . friar thomas . may your grace speak of it ? duke . my holy sir, none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed, and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps . i have delivered to lord angelo, a man of stricture and firm abstinence, my absolute power and place here in vienna, and he supposes me travelled to poland; for so i have strewed it in the common ear, and so it is received . now, pious sir, you will demand of me why i do this ? friar thomas . gladly, my lord . duke . we have strict statutes and most biting laws, the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, which for this fourteen years we have let slip, even like an oergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey . now, as fond fathers, having bound up the threatning twigs of birch, only to stick it in their childrens sight for terror, not to use, in time the rod becomes more mocked than feared: so our decrees, dead to infliction, to themselves are dead, and liberty plucks justice by the nose, the baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart goes all decorum . friar thomas . it rested in your grace to unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased; and it in you more dreadful would have seemed than in lord angelo . duke . i do fear, too dreadful . sith twas my fault to give the people scope, twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do; for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment . therefore, indeed, my father, i have on angelo imposed the office; who may in th ambush of my name strike home, and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander . and to behold his sway, i will, as twere a brother of your order, visit both prince and people . therefore, i prithee, supply me with the habit, and instruct me how i may formally in person bear like a true friar . moe reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you; only, this one: lord angelo is precise; stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone . hence shall we see, if power change purpose, what our seemers be . exeunt . scene iv . a nunnery . enter isabella and francisca, a nun . isabella . and have you nuns no farther privileges ? francisca . are not these large enough ? isabella . yes, truly; i speak not as desiring more, but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood, the votarists of saint clare . lucio . within . ho ! peace be in this place ! isabella . whos that which calls ? francisca . it is a mans voice . gentle isabella, turn you the key, and know his business of him; you may, i may not; you are yet unsworn . when you have vowed, you must not speak with men but in the presence of the prioress; then, if you speak, you must not show your face; or if you show your face, you must not speak . he calls again . i pray you answer him . exit francisca . isabella . peace and prosperity ! who ist that calls ? enter lucio . lucio . hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheekroses proclaim you are no less . can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella, a novice of this place, and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio ? isabella . why her unhappy brother ? let me ask, the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella, and his sister . lucio . gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you . not to be weary with you, hes in prison . isabella . woe me ! for what ? lucio . for that which, if myself might be his judge, he should receive his punishment in thanks: he hath got his friend with child . isabella . sir, make me not your story . lucio . tis true . i would not, though tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest, tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so . i hold you as a thing enskied and sainted by your renouncement an immortal spirit, and to be talked with in sincerity, as with a saint . isabella . you do blaspheme the good in mocking me . lucio . do not believe it . fewness and truth, tis thus: your brother and his lover have embraced; as those that feed grow full, as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry . isabella . someone with child by him ? my cousin juliet ? lucio . is she your cousin ? isabella . adoptedly, as schoolmaids change their names by vain though apt affection . lucio . she it is . isabella . o, let him marry her ! lucio . this is the point . the duke is very strangely gone from hence; bore many gentlemen, myself being one, in hand, and hope of action; but we do learn, by those that know the very nerves of state, his givingsout were of an infinite distance from his truemeant design . upon his place, and with full line of his authority, governs lord angelo; a man whose blood is very snowbroth; one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense; but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind, study and fast . he, to give fear to use and liberty, which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lions, hath picked out an act, under whose heavy sense your brothers life falls into forfeit . he arrests him on it, and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example . all hope is gone, unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo . and thats my pith of business twixt you and your poor brother . isabella . doth he so seek his life ? lucio . has censured him already; and, as i hear, the provost hath a warrant fors execution . isabella . alas, what poor abilitys in me to do him good ? lucio . assay the power you have . isabella . my power ? alas, i doubt . lucio . our doubts are traitors, and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt . go to lord angelo, and let him learn to know, when maidens sue, men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel, all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them . isabella . ill see what i can do . lucio . but speedily . isabella . i will about it straight; no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair . i humbly thank you . commend me to my brother . soon at night ill send him certain word of my success . lucio . i take my leave of you . isabella . good sir, adieu . exeunt . act ii scene i . a hall in angelos house . enter angelo, escalus, servants, and a justice . angelo . we must not make a scarecrow of the law, setting it up to fear the birds of prey, and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch, and not their terror . escalus . ay, but yet let us be keen, and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to death . alas, this gentleman, whom i would save, had a most noble father . let but your honour know, whom i believe to be most strait in virtue, that, in the working of your own affections, had time cohered with place, or place with wishing, or that the resolute acting of your blood could have attained th effect of your own purpose, whether you had not sometime in your life erred in this point which now you censure him, and pulled the law upon you . angelo . tis one thing to be tempted, escalus, another thing to fall . i not deny the jury passing on the prisoners life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try . whats open made to justice, that justice seizes . what knows the laws that thieves do pass on thieves ? tis very pregnant, the jewel that we find, we stoop and take t, because we see it; but what we do not see, we tread upon, and never think of it . you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults; but rather tell me, when i that censure him do so offend, let mine own judgement pattern out my death, and nothing come in partial . sir, he must die . enter provost . escalus . be it as your wisdom will . angelo . where is the provost ?

isabella . i am a woeful suitor to your honour, please but your honour hear me . angelo . well, whats your suit ? isabella . there is a vice that most i do abhor, and most desire should meet the blow of justice; for which i would not plead, but that i must; for which i must not plead, but that i am at war twixt will and will not . angelo . well, the matter ? isabella . i have a brother is condemned to die; i do beseech you, let it be his fault, and not my brother . provost . heaven give thee moving graces . angelo . condemn the fault, and not the actor of it ? why, every faults condemned ere it be done . mine were the very cipher of a function to find the faults whose fine stands in record, and let go by the actor . isabella . o just but severe law ! i had a brother, then . heaven keep your honour ! going . lucio . to isabella . givet not oer so . to him again, entreat him, kneel down before him, hang upon his gown; you are too cold . if you should need a pin, you could not with more tame a tongue desire it . to him, i say . isabella . must he needs die ? angelo . maiden, no remedy . isabella . yes, i do think that you might pardon him, and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy . angelo . i will not dot . isabella . but can you if you would ? angelo . look, what i will not, that i cannot do . isabella . but might you dot, and do the world no wrong, if so your heart were touched with that remorse as mine is to him ? angelo . hes sentenced, tis too late . lucio . to isabella . you are too cold . isabella . too late ? why, no . i that do speak a word may call it back again . well, believe this: no ceremony that to great ones longs, not the kings crown, nor the deputed sword, the marshals truncheon, nor the judges robe, become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does . if he had been as you, and you as he, you would have slipped like him, but he like you would not have been so stern . angelo . pray you be gone . isabella . i would to heaven i had your potency, and you were isabel ! should it then be thus ? no; i would tell what twere to be a judge and what a prisoner . lucio . aside . ay, touch him; theres the vein . angelo . your brother is a forfeit of the law, and you but waste your words . isabella . alas, alas ! why, all the souls that were were forfeit once, and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy . how would you be if he, which is the top of judgement, should but judge you as you are ? o, think on that, and mercy then will breathe within your lips, like man new made . angelo . be you content, fair maid . it is the law, not i, condemns your brother . were he my kinsman, brother, or my son, it should be thus with him . he must die tomorrow . isabella . tomorrow ? o, thats sudden ! spare him, spare him ! hes not prepared for death . even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season . shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves ? good, good my lord, bethink you . who is it that hath died for this offence ? theres many have committed it . lucio . ay, well said . angelo . the law hath not been dead, though it hath slept . those many had not dared to do that evil if the first that did th edict infringe had answered for his deed . now tis awake, takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet, looks in a glass that shows what future evils, either now, or by remissness new conceived, and so in progress to be hatched and born, are now to have no successive degrees, but, where they live, to end . isabella . yet show some pity . angelo . i show it most of all when i show justice; for then i pity those i do not know, which a dismissed offence would after gall, and do him right that, answering one foul wrong, lives not to act another . be satisfied; your brother dies tomorrow; be content . isabella . so you must be the first that gives this sentence, and he that suffers . o, it is excellent to have a giants strength; but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant . lucio . thats well said . isabella . could great men thunder as jove himself does, jove would neer be quiet, for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder . nothing but thunder . merciful heaven, thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak, than the soft myrtle . but man, proud man, dressed in a little brief authority, most ignorant of what hes most assured, his glassy essence, like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as makes the angels weep; who, with our spleens, would all themselves laugh mortal . lucio . o, to him, to him, wench ! he will relent; hes coming . i perceive t . provost . pray heaven she win him . isabella . we cannot weigh our brother with ourself . great men may jest with saints; tis wit in them, but in the less, foul profanation . lucio . thourt i th right, girl; more o that . isabella . that in the captains but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy . lucio . art advised o that ? more ont . angelo . why do you put these sayings upon me ? isabella . because authority, though it err like others, hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o th top . go to your bosom, knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know thats like my brothers fault . if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his, let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brothers life . angelo . she speaks, and tis such sense that my sense breeds with it . going . fare you well . isabella . gentle my lord, turn back . angelo . i will bethink me . come again tomorrow . isabella . hark how ill bribe you . good my lord, turn back . angelo . how ? bribe me ? isabella . ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you . lucio . you had marred all else . isabella . not with fond shekels of the tested gold, or stones, whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them, but with true prayers, that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sunrise, prayers from preserved souls, from fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal . angelo . well; come to me tomorrow . lucio . aside to isabella . go to, tis well; away . isabella . heaven keep your honour safe . angelo . aside . amen . for i am that way going to temptation, where prayers cross . isabella . at what hour tomorrow shall i attend your lordship ? angelo . at any time fore noon . isabella . save your honour . exeunt isabella, lucio and provost . angelo . from thee, even from thy virtue ! whats this ? whats this ? is this her fault or mine ? the tempter or the tempted, who sins most, ha ? not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is i that, lying by the violet in the sun, do as the carrion does, not as the flower, corrupt with virtuous season . can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than womans lightness ? having waste ground enough, shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there ? o, fie, fie, fie ! what dost thou, or what art thou, angelo ? dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good ? o, let her brother live . thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves . what, do i love her, that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes ? what ist i dream on ? o cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint, with saints dost bait thy hook ! most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue . never could the strumpet with all her double vigour, art, and nature, once stir my temper, but this virtuous maid subdues me quite . ever till now when men were fond, i smiled and wondered how . exit . scene iii . a room in a prison . enter duke disguised as a friar, and provost . duke . hail to you, provost, so i think you are . provost . i am the provost . whats your will, good friar ? duke . bound by my charity and my blessed order, i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison . do me the common right to let me see them, and to make me know the nature of their crimes, that i may minister to them accordingly . provost . i would do more than that, if more were needful . enter juliet . look, here comes one, a gentlewoman of mine, who, falling in the flaws of her own youth, hath blistered her report . she is with child, and he that got it, sentenced: a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this . duke . when must he die ? provost . as i do think, tomorrow . to juliet . i have provided for you; stay a while and you shall be conducted . duke . repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry ? juliet . i do; and bear the shame most patiently . duke . ill teach you how you shall arraign your conscience, and try your penitence, if it be sound or hollowly put on . juliet . ill gladly learn . duke . love you the man that wronged you ? juliet . yes, as i love the woman that wronged him . duke . so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed ? juliet . mutually . duke . then was your sin of heavier kind than his . juliet . i do confess it, and repent it, father . duke . tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame, which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven, showing we would not spare heaven as we love it, but as we stand in fear juliet . i do repent me as it is an evil, and take the shame with joy . duke . there rest . your partner, as i hear, must die tomorrow, and i am going with instruction to him . grace go with you ! benedicite ! exit . juliet . must die tomorrow ? o, injurious love that respites me a life, whose very comfort is still a dying horror ! provost . tis pity of him . exeunt . scene iv . a room in angelos house . enter angelo . angelo . when i would pray and think, i think and pray to several subjects . heaven hath my empty words, whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue, anchors on isabel . heaven in my mouth, as if i did but only chew his name, and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception . the state whereon i studied is, like a good thing being often read, grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity, whereinlet no man hear mei take pride, could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain . o place, o form, how often dost thou with thy case, thy habit, wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming ! blood, thou art blood . lets write good angel on the devils horn . tis not the devils crest . knock within . how now, whos there ? enter servant . servant . one isabel, a sister, desires access to you . angelo . teach her the way . exit servant . o heavens, why does my blood thus muster to my heart, making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness ? so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons, come all to help him, and so stop the air by which he should revive . and even so the general subject to a wellwished king quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence, where their untaught love must needs appear offence . enter isabella . how now, fair maid ? isabella . i am come to know your pleasure . angelo . that you might know it, would much better please me than to demand what tis . your brother cannot live . isabella . even so . heaven keep your honour . angelo . yet may he live a while . and, it may be, as long as you or i . yet he must die . isabella . under your sentence ? angelo . yea . isabella . when, i beseech you ? that in his reprieve, longer or shorter, he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not . angelo . ha ! fie, these filthy vices ! it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made, as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image in stamps that are forbid . tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one . isabella . tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth . angelo . say you so ? then i shall pose you quickly . which had you rather, that the most just law now took your brothers life; or, to redeem him, give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath stained ? isabella . sir, believe this: i had rather give my body than my soul . angelo . i talk not of your soul . our compelled sins stand more for number than for accompt . isabella . how say you ? angelo . nay, ill not warrant that, for i can speak against the thing i say . answer to this: i, now the voice of the recorded law, pronounce a sentence on your brothers life . might there not be a charity in sin to save this brothers life ? isabella . please you to dot, ill take it as a peril to my soul; it is no sin at all, but charity . angelo . pleased you to dot at peril of your soul, were equal poise of sin and charity . isabella . that i do beg his life, if it be sin, heaven let me bear it . you granting of my suit, if that be sin, ill make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine, and nothing of your answer . angelo . nay, but hear me . your sense pursues not mine . either you are ignorant, or seem so, crafty; and thats not good . isabella . let me be ignorant, and in nothing good, but graciously to know i am no better . angelo . thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself, as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could, displayed . but mark me; to be received plain, ill speak more gross . your brother is to die . isabella . so . angelo . and his offence is so, as it appears, accountant to the law upon that pain . isabella . true . angelo . admit no other way to save his life as i subscribe not that, nor any other, but, in the loss of question, that you, his sister, finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge, or own great place, could fetch your brother from the manacles of the allbinding law; and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed, or else to let him suffer, what would you do ? isabella . as much for my poor brother as myself . that is, were i under the terms of death, th impression of keen whips id wear as rubies, and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for, ere id yield my body up to shame . angelo . then must your brother die . isabella . and twere the cheaper way . better it were a brother died at once than that a sister, by redeeming him, should die for ever . angelo . were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slandered so ? isabella . ignominy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses . lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption . angelo . you seemed of late to make the law a tyrant, and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice . isabella . o, pardon me, my lord . it oft falls out, to have what we would have, we speak not what we mean . i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love . angelo . we are all frail . isabella . else let my brother die, if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed by weakness . angelo . nay, women are frail too . isabella . ay, as the glasses where they view themselves, which are as easy broke as they make forms . women ? help, heaven ! men their creation mar in profiting by them . nay, call us ten times frail; for we are soft as our complexions are, and credulous to false prints . angelo . i think it well . and from this testimony of your own sex, since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold . i do arrest your words . be that you are, that is, a woman . if you be more, youre none . if you be one, as you are well expressed by all external warrants, show it now by putting on the destined livery . isabella . i have no tongue but one . gentle my lord, let me intreat you speak the former language . angelo . plainly conceive, i love you . isabella . my brother did love juliet, and you tell me that he shall die for t . angelo . he shall not, isabel, if you give me love . isabella . i know your virtue hath a license int, which seems a little fouler than it is, to pluck on others . angelo . believe me, on mine honour, my words express my purpose . isabella . ha ! little honour to be much believed, and most pernicious purpose ! seeming, seeming ! i will proclaim thee, angelo, look fort . sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretched throat ill tell the world aloud what man thou art . angelo . who will believe thee, isabel ? my unsoiled name, th austereness of my life, my vouch against you, and my place i th state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report, and smell of calumny . i have begun, and now i give my sensual race the rein . fit thy consent to my sharp appetite; lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for . redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will; or else he must not only die the death, but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingring sufferance . answer me tomorrow, or, by the affection that now guides me most, ill prove a tyrant to him . as for you, say what you can, my false oerweighs your true . exit . isabella . to whom should i complain ? did i tell this, who would believe me ? o perilous mouths, that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue either of condemnation or approof, bidding the law make curtsy to their will, hooking both right and wrong to th appetite, to follow as it draws ! ill to my brother . though he hath falln by prompture of the blood, yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that, had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks, hed yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorred pollution . then, isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die . more than our brother is our chastity . ill tell him yet of angelos request, and fit his mind to death, for his souls rest . exit . act iii scene i . a room in the prison . enter duke, claudio and provost . duke . so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo ? claudio . the miserable have no other medicine but only hope . i have hope to live, and am prepared to die . duke . be absolute for death . either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter . reason thus with life: if i do lose thee, i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep . a breath thou art, servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou keepst hourly afflict . merely, thou art deaths fool; for him thou labourst by thy flight to shun, and yet runnst toward him still . thou art not noble; for all th accommodations that thou bearst are nursed by baseness . thourt by no means valiant; for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm . thy best of rest is sleep, and that thou oft provokst, yet grossly fearst thy death, which is no more . thou art not thyself; for thou exists on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust . happy thou art not; for what thou hast not, still thou strivst to get, and what thou hast, forgetst . thou art not certain; for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon . if thou art rich, thourt poor; for, like an ass whose back with ingots bows, thou bearst thy heavy riches but a journey, and death unloads thee . friend hast thou none; for thine own bowels which do call thee sire, the mere effusion of thy proper loins, do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum for ending thee no sooner . thou hast nor youth nor age, but as it were an afterdinners sleep dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich, thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant . whats yet in this that bears the name of life ? yet in this life lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear, that makes these odds all even . claudio . i humbly thank you . to sue to live, i find i seek to die, and seeking death, find life . let it come on . isabella . within . what ho ! peace here; grace and good company ! provost . whos there ? come in . the wish deserves a welcome . duke . dear sir, ere long ill visit you again . claudio . most holy sir, i thank you . enter isabella . isabella . my business is a word or two with claudio . provost . and very welcome . look, signior, heres your sister . duke . provost, a word with you . provost . as many as you please . duke . bring me to hear them speak, where i may be concealed . exeunt duke and provost . claudio . now, sister, whats the comfort ? isabella . why, as all comforts are, most good, most good indeed . lord angelo, having affairs to heaven, intends you for his swift ambassador, where you shall be an everlasting leiger . therefore your best appointment make with speed; tomorrow you set on . claudio . is there no remedy ? isabella . none, but such remedy as, to save a head, to cleave a heart in twain . claudio . but is there any ? isabella . yes, brother, you may live . there is a devilish mercy in the judge, if youll implore it, that will free your life, but fetter you till death . claudio . perpetual durance ? isabella . ay, just; perpetual durance; a restraint, though all the worlds vastidity you had, to a determined scope . claudio . but in what nature ? isabella . in such a one as, you consenting tot, would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, and leave you naked . claudio . let me know the point . isabella . o, i do fear thee, claudio, and i quake, lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain, and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour . darst thou die ? the sense of death is most in apprehension; and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies . claudio . why give you me this shame ? think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness ? if i must die, i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms . isabella . there spake my brother ! there my fathers grave did utter forth a voice . yes, thou must die . thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances . this outwardsainted deputy, whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i th head, and follies doth enew as falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil . his filth within being cast, he would appear a pond as deep as hell . claudio . the precise angelo ? isabella . o, tis the cunning livery of hell the damnedst body to invest and cover in precise guards ! dost thou think, claudio, if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed ? claudio . o heavens, it cannot be . isabella . yes, he would give it thee, from this rank offence, so to offend him still . this nights the time that i should do what i abhor to name, or else thou diest tomorrow . claudio . thou shalt not dot . isabella . o, were it but my life, id throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin . claudio . thanks, dear isabel . isabella . be ready, claudio, for your death tomorrow . claudio . yes . has he affections in him that thus can make him bite the law by th nose when he would force it ? sure it is no sin; or of the deadly seven it is the least . isabella . which is the least ? claudio . if it were damnable, he being so wise, why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fined ? o isabel ! isabella . what says my brother ? claudio . death is a fearful thing . isabella . and shamed life a hateful . claudio . ay, but to die, and go we know not where; to lie in cold obstruction, and to rot; this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods, or to reside in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice; to be imprisoned in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world; or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howlingtis too horrible . the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age, ache, penury, and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death . isabella . alas, alas ! claudio . sweet sister, let me live . what sin you do to save a brothers life, nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue . isabella . o, you beast ! o faithless coward ! o dishonest wretch ! wilt thou be made a man out of my vice ? ist not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sisters shame ? what should i think ? heaven shield my mother played my father fair, for such a warped slip of wilderness neer issued from his blood . take my defiance, die, perish ! might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed . ill pray a thousand prayers for thy death, no word to save thee . claudio . nay, hear me, isabel . isabella . o fie, fie, fie ! thy sins not accidental, but a trade . mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd . tis best that thou diest quickly . going . claudio . o, hear me, isabella . enter duke as a friar . duke . vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word . isabella . what is your will ? duke . might you dispense with your leisure, i would by and by have some speech with you . the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit . isabella . i have no superfluous leisure, my stay must be stolen out of other affairs, but i will attend you a while . duke . to claudio aside . son, i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister . angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practise his judgement with the disposition of natures . she, having the truth of honour in her, hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive . i am confessor to angelo, and i know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to death . do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible . tomorrow you must die; go to your knees and make ready . claudio . let me ask my sister pardon . i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it . duke . hold you there . farewell . exit claudio . enter provost . provost, a word with you . provost . whats your will, father ? duke . that, now you are come, you will be gone . leave me a while with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company . provost . in good time . exit provost . duke . the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good . the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair . the assault that angelo hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling, i should wonder at angelo . how will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother ? isabella . i am now going to resolve him . i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born . but, o, how much is the good duke deceived in angelo ! if ever he return, and i can speak to him, i will open my lips in vain, or discover his government . duke . that shall not be much amiss . yet, as the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only . therefore fasten your ear on my advisings, to the love i have in doing good, a remedy presents itself . i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious person; and much please the absent duke, if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business . isabella . let me hear you speak farther . i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit . duke . virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful . have you not heard speak of mariana, the sister of frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at sea ? isabella . i have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name . duke . she should this angelo have married, was affianced to her oath, and the nuptial appointed . between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity, her brother frederick was wrecked at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister . but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman . there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with both, her combinate husband, this wellseeming angelo . isabella . can this be so ? did angelo so leave her ? duke . left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort, swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour; in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them, but relents not . isabella . what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world ! what corruption in this life, that it will let this man live ! but how out of this can she avail ? duke . it is a rupture that you may easily heal, and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in doing it . isabella . show me how, good father . duke . this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection . his unjust unkindness, that in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it more violent and unruly . go you to angelo; answer his requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands to the point . only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience . this being granted in course, and now follows all . we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your place . if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled . the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt . if you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof . what think you of it ? isabella . the image of it gives me content already, and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection . duke . it lies much in your holding up . haste you speedily to angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction . i will presently to saint lukes; there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana . at that place call upon me; and dispatch with angelo, that it may be quickly . isabella . i thank you for this comfort . fare you well, good father . exit isabella . scene ii . the street before the prison . enter elbow, pompey and officers . elbow . nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard . duke . o heavens, what stuff is here ? pompey . twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and furred with fox on lambskins too, to signify that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing . elbow . come your way, sir . bless you, good father friar . duke . and you, good brother father . what offence hath this man made you, sir ? elbow . marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy . duke . fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd; the evil that thou causest to be done, that is thy means to live . do thou but think what tis to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice . say to thyself, from their abominable and beastly touches i drink, i eat, array myself, and live . canst thou believe thy living is a life, so stinkingly depending ? go mend, go mend . pompey . indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir . but yet, sir, i would prove duke . nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin, thou wilt prove his . take him to prison, officer . correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit . elbow . he must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning . the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster . if he be a whoremonger and comes before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand . duke . that we were all, as some would seem to be, free from our faults, as faults from seeming, free ! elbow . his neck will come to your waista cord, sir . enter lucio . pompey . i spy comfort, i cry bail ! heres a gentleman, and a friend of mine . lucio . how now, noble pompey ? what, at the wheels of caesar ? art thou led in triumph ? what, is there none of pygmalions images, newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutched ? what reply, ha ? what sayst thou to this tune, matter, and method ? ist not drowned i th last rain, ha ? what sayst thou, trot ? is the world as it was, man ? which is the way ? is it sad and few words ? or how ? the trick of it ? duke . still thus, and thus; still worse ! lucio . how doth my dear morsel, thy mistress ? procures she still, ha ? pompey . troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub . lucio . why, tis good . it is the right of it . it must be so . ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd; an unshunned consequence; it must be so . art going to prison, pompey ? pompey . yes, faith, sir . lucio . why, tis not amiss, pompey . farewell . go, say i sent thee thither . for debt, pompey ? or how ? elbow . for being a bawd, for being a bawd . lucio . well, then, imprison him . if imprisonment be the due of a bawd, why, tis his right . bawd is he doubtless, and of antiquity, too . bawd born . farewell, good pompey . commend me to the prison, pompey . you will turn good husband now, pompey; you will keep the house . pompey . i hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail . lucio . no, indeed, will i not, pompey; it is not the wear . i will pray, pompey, to increase your bondage . if you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the more . adieu, trusty pompey . bless you, friar . duke . and you . lucio . does bridget paint still, pompey, ha ? elbow . come your ways, sir, come . pompey . you will not bail me then, sir ? lucio . then, pompey, nor now . what news abroad, friar ? what news ? elbow . come your ways, sir, come . lucio . go to kennel, pompey, go . exeunt elbow, pompey and officers . what news, friar, of the duke ? duke . i know none . can you tell me of any ? lucio . some say he is with the emperor of russia; other some, he is in rome . but where is he, think you ? duke . i know not where, but wheresoever, i wish him well . lucio . it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to . lord angelo dukes it well in his absence . he puts transgression tot . duke . he does well int . lucio . a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him . something too crabbed that way, friar . duke . it is too general a vice, and severity must cure it . lucio . yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down . they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation . is it true, think you ? duke . how should he be made, then ? lucio . some report a seamaid spawned him; some, that he was begot between two stockfishes . but it is certain that when he makes water, his urine is congealed ice; that i know to be true . and he is a motion ungenerative; thats infallible . duke . you are pleasant, sir, and speak apace . lucio . why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man ! would the duke that is absent have done this ? ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand . he had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy . duke . i never heard the absent duke much detected for women; he was not inclined that way . lucio . o, sir, you are deceived . duke . tis not possible . lucio . who, not the duke ? yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish . the duke had crotchets in him . he would be drunk too, that let me inform you . duke . you do him wrong, surely . lucio . sir, i was an inward of his . a shy fellow was the duke; and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing . duke . what, i prithee, might be the cause ? lucio . no, pardon . tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips . but this i can let you understand: the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise . duke . wise ? why, no question but he was . lucio . a very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow . duke . either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking . the very stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation . let him be but testimonied in his own bringingsforth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier . therefore you speak unskilfully . or, if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in your malice . lucio . sir, i know him, and i love him . duke . love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love . lucio . come, sir, i know what i know . duke . i can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak . but, if ever the duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your answer before him . if it be honest you have spoke, you have courage to maintain it . i am bound to call upon you, and i pray you your name ? lucio . sir, my name is lucio, well known to the duke . duke . he shall know you better, sir, if i may live to report you . lucio . i fear you not . duke . o, you hope the duke will return no more; or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite . but indeed, i can do you little harm . youll forswear this again . lucio . ill be hanged first ! thou art deceived in me, friar . but no more of this . canst thou tell if claudio die tomorrow or no ? duke . why should he die, sir ? lucio . why ? for filling a bottle with a tundish . i would the duke we talk of were returned again . this ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency . sparrows must not build in his houseeaves because they are lecherous . the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered . he would never bring them to light . would he were returned ! marry, this claudio is condemned for untrussing . farewell, good friar, i prithee pray for me . the duke, i say to thee again, would eat mutton on fridays . hes now past it; yet, and, i say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic . say that i said so . farewell . exit . duke . no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape . backwounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes . what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue ? but who comes here ? enter escalus, provost and officers with mistress overdone, a bawd . escalus . go, away with her to prison . bawd . good my lord, be good to me . your honour is accounted a merciful man, good my lord . escalus . double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind ? this would make mercy swear and play the tyrant . provost . a bawd of eleven years continuance, may it please your honour . bawd . my lord, this is one lucios information against me . mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the dukes time; he promised her marriage . his child is a year and a quarter old come philip and jacob . i have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me . escalus . that fellow is a fellow of much license . let him be called before us . away with her to prison . go to, no more words . exeunt officers with bawd . provost, my brother angelo will not be altered; claudio must die tomorrow . let him be furnished with divines, and have all charitable preparation . if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him . provost . so please you, this friar hath been with him, and advised him for th entertainment of death . escalus . good even, good father . duke . bliss and goodness on you ! escalus . of whence are you ? duke . not of this country, though my chance is now to use it for my time . i am a brother of gracious order, late come from the see in special business from his holiness . escalus . what news abroad i th world ? duke . none, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it . novelty is only in request, and as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking . there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough to make fellowships accursed . much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world . this news is old enough, yet it is every days news . i pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke ? escalus . one that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself . duke . what pleasure was he given to ? escalus . rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at anything which professed to make him rejoice . a gentleman of all temperance . but leave we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepared . i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation . duke . he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice . yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which i, by my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolved to die . escalus . you have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt of your calling . i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have i found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed justice . duke . if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself . escalus . i am going to visit the prisoner . fare you well . duke . peace be with you . exeunt escalus and provost . he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe, pattern in himself to know, grace to stand, and virtue go; more nor less to others paying than by selfoffences weighing . shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking ! twice treble shame on angelo, to weed my vice, and let his grow ! o, what may man within him hide, though angel on the outward side ! how may likeness, made in crimes, make practice on the times, to draw with idle spiders strings most ponderous and substantial things ! craft against vice i must apply . with angelo tonight shall lie his old betrothed but despised . so disguise shall, by th disguised, pay with falsehood false exacting, and perform an old contracting . exit . act iv scene i . a room in marianas house . enter mariana and a boy singing . song take, o take those lips away, that so sweetly were forsworn, and those eyes, the break of day, lights that do mislead the morn . but my kisses bring again, bring again; seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain . enter duke as a friar . mariana . break off thy song, and haste thee quick away; here comes a man of comfort, whose advice hath often stilled my brawling discontent . exit boy . i cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish you had not found me here so musical . let me excuse me, and believe me so, my mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe . duke . tis good; though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm . i pray you tell me, hath anybody inquired for me here today ? much upon this time have i promised here to meet . mariana . you have not been inquired after . i have sat here all day . enter isabella . duke . i do constantly believe you . the time is come even now . i shall crave your forbearance a little . maybe i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself . mariana . i am always bound to you . exit . duke . very well met, and welcome . what is the news from this good deputy ? isabella . he hath a garden circummured with brick, whose western side is with a vineyard backed; and to that vineyard is a planched gate that makes his opening with this bigger key . this other doth command a little door which from the vineyard to the garden leads; there have i made my promise, upon the heavy middle of the night to call on him . duke . but shall you on your knowledge find this way ? isabella . i have taen a due and wary note upont; with whispering and most guilty diligence, in action all of precept, he did show me the way twice oer . duke . are there no other tokens between you greed concerning her observance ? isabella . no, none, but only a repair i th dark, and that i have possessed him my most stay can be but brief, for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along, that stays upon me; whose persuasion is i come about my brother . duke . tis well borne up . i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this . what ho, within ! come forth . enter mariana . i pray you be acquainted with this maid; she comes to do you good . isabella . i do desire the like . duke . do you persuade yourself that i respect you ?

lucio . marry, sir, i think, if you handled her privately, she would sooner confess; perchance, publicly, shell be ashamed . enter at several doors duke as a friar, provost and isabella with officers . escalus . i will go darkly to work with her . lucio . thats the way; for women are light at midnight . escalus . to isabella . come on, mistress, heres a gentlewoman denies all that you have said . lucio . my lord, here comes the rascal i spoke of, here with the provost . escalus . in very good time . speak not you to him till we call upon you . lucio . mum . escalus . come, sir, did you set these women on to slander lord angelo ?

then is your cause gone too . the dukes unjust thus to retort your manifest appeal, and put your trial in the villains mouth which here you come to accuse . lucio . this is the rascal; this is he i spoke of . escalus . why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar, ist not enough thou hast suborned these women to accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth, and in the witness of his proper ear, to call him villain ? and then to glance from him to th duke himself, to tax him with injustice ? take him hence ! to th rack with him ! well touse you joint by joint, but we will know his purpose . what ! unjust ? duke . be not so hot . the duke dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he dare rack his own . his subject am i not, nor here provincial . my business in this state made me a lookeron here in vienna, where i have seen corruption boil and bubble till it oerrun the stew . laws for all faults, but faults so countenanced that the strong statutes stand like the forfeits in a barbers shop, as much in mock as mark . escalus . slander to the state ! away with him to prison ! angelo . what can you vouch against him, signior lucio ? is this the man that you did tell us of ? lucio . tis he, my lord . come hither, goodman baldpate . do you know me ? duke . i remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice . i met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke . lucio . o did you so ? and do you remember what you said of the duke ? duke . most notedly, sir . lucio . do you so, sir ? and was the duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be ? duke . you must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report . you indeed spoke so of him, and much more, much worse . lucio . o thou damnable fellow ! did not i pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches ? duke . i protest i love the duke as i love myself . angelo . hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable abuses ! escalus . such a fellow is not to be talked withal . away with him to prison ! where is the provost ? away with him to prison ! lay bolts enough upon him . let him speak no more . away with those giglets too, and with the other confederate companion ! the provost lays hands on the duke . duke . stay, sir, stay a while . angelo . what, resists he ? help him, lucio . lucio . come, sir, come, sir, come, sir . foh, sir ! why, you baldpated lying rascal ! you must be hooded, must you ? show your knaves visage, with a pox to you ! show your sheepbiting face, and be hanged an hour ! willt not off ? pulls off the friars hood and discovers the duke . duke . thou art the first knave that eer madst a duke . first, provost, let me bail these gentle three . to lucio . sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you must have a word anon . lay hold on him . lucio . this may prove worse than hanging . duke . to escalus . what you have spoke i pardon . sit you down . well borrow place of him . to angelo . sir, by your leave . hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence, that yet can do thee office ? if thou hast, rely upon it till my tale be heard, and hold no longer out . angelo . o my dread lord, i should be guiltier than my guiltiness to think i can be undiscernible, when i perceive your grace, like power divine, hath looked upon my passes . then, good prince, no longer session hold upon my shame, but let my trial be mine own confession . immediate sentence then, and sequent death is all the grace i beg . duke . come hither, mariana . say, wast thou eer contracted to this woman ? angelo . i was, my lord . duke . go, take her hence and marry her instantly . do you the office, friar; which consummate, return him here again . go with him, provost . exeunt angelo, mariana, friar peter and provost . escalus . my lord, i am more amazed at his dishonour than at the strangeness of it . duke . come hither, isabel . your friar is now your prince . as i was then advertising and holy to your business, not changing heart with habit, i am still attorneyed at your service . isabella . o, give me pardon, that i, your vassal, have employed and pained your unknown sovereignty . duke . you are pardoned, isabel . and now, dear maid, be you as free to us . your brothers death, i know, sits at your heart, and you may marvel why i obscured myself, labouring to save his life, and would not rather make rash remonstrance of my hidden power than let him so be lost . o most kind maid, it was the swift celerity of his death, which i did think with slower foot came on, that brained my purpose . but peace be with him . that life is better life, past fearing death, than that which lives to fear . make it your comfort, so happy is your brother . isabella . i do, my lord . enter angelo, mariana, friar peter and provost . duke . for this newmarried man approaching here, whose salt imagination yet hath wronged your welldefended honour, you must pardon for marianas sake . but as he adjudged your brother, being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promisebreach thereon dependent, for your brothers life, the very mercy of the law cries out most audible, even from his proper tongue, an angelo for claudio, death for death . haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; like doth quit like, and measure still for measure . then, angelo, thy faults thus manifested, which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage . we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stooped to death, and with like haste . away with him . mariana . o my most gracious lord, i hope you will not mock me with a husband . duke . it is your husband mocked you with a husband . consenting to the safeguard of your honour, i thought your marriage fit . else imputation, for that he knew you, might reproach your life, and choke your good to come . for his possessions, although by confiscation they are ours, we do instate and widow you with all to buy you a better husband . mariana . o my dear lord, i crave no other, nor no better man . duke . never crave him; we are definitive . mariana . kneeling . gentle my liege duke . you do but lose your labour . away with him to death . to lucio . now, sir, to you . mariana . o my good lord . sweet isabel, take my part; lend me your knees, and all my life to come ill lend you all my life to do you service . duke . against all sense you do importune her . should she kneel down in mercy of this fact, her brothers ghost his paved bed would break, and take her hence in horror . mariana . isabel, sweet isabel, do yet but kneel by me; hold up your hands, say nothing . ill speak all . they say best men are moulded out of faults, and, for the most, become much more the better for being a little bad . so may my husband . o isabel, will you not lend a knee ? duke . he dies for claudios death . isabella . kneeling . most bounteous sir, look, if it please you, on this man condemned as if my brother lived . i partly think a due sincerity governed his deeds till he did look on me . since it is so, let him not die . my brother had but justice, in that he did the thing for which he died . for angelo, his act did not oertake his bad intent, and must be buried but as an intent that perished by the way . thoughts are no subjects; intents but merely thoughts . mariana . merely, my lord . duke . your suits unprofitable . stand up, i say . i have bethought me of another fault . provost, how came it claudio was beheaded at an unusual hour ? provost . it was commanded so . duke . had you a special warrant for the deed ? provost . no, my good lord, it was by private message . duke . for which i do discharge you of your office . give up your keys . provost . pardon me, noble lord . i thought it was a fault, but knew it not; yet did repent me after more advice . for testimony whereof, one in the prison that should by private order else have died, i have reserved alive . duke . whats he ? provost . his name is barnardine . duke . i would thou hadst done so by claudio . go fetch him hither, let me look upon him . exit provost . escalus . i am sorry one so learned and so wise as you, lord angelo, have still appeared, should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood and lack of tempered judgement afterward . angelo . i am sorry that such sorrow i procure, and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart that i crave death more willingly than mercy; tis my deserving, and i do entreat it . enter provost with barnardine, claudio muffled and juliet . duke . which is that barnardine ? provost . this, my lord . duke . there was a friar told me of this man . sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul that apprehends no further than this world, and squarst thy life according . thourt condemned; but, for those earthly faults, i quit them all, and pray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to come . friar, advise him; i leave him to your hand . what muffled fellows that ? provost . this is another prisoner that i saved, who should have died when claudio lost his head; as like almost to claudio as himself . unmuffles claudio . duke . to isabella . if he be like your brother, for his sake is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake, give me your hand and say you will be mine . he is my brother too . but fitter time for that . by this lord angelo perceives hes safe; methinks i see a quickning in his eye . well, angelo, your evil quits you well . look that you love your wife, her worth worth yours . i find an apt remission in myself . and yet heres one in place i cannot pardon . to lucio . you, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward, one all of luxury, an ass, a madman . wherein have i so deserved of you that you extol me thus ? lucio . faith, my lord, i spoke it but according to the trick . if you will hang me for it, you may, but i had rather it would please you i might be whipped . duke . whipped first, sir, and hanged after . proclaim it, provost, round about the city, if any woman wronged by this lewd fellow, as i have heard him swear himself theres one whom he begot with childlet her appear, and he shall marry her . the nuptial finished, let him be whipped and hanged . lucio . i beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore . your highness said even now i made you a duke; good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold . duke . upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her . thy slanders i forgive, and therewithal remit thy other forfeits . take him to prison, and see our pleasure herein executed . lucio . marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging . duke . slandering a prince deserves it . exeunt officers with lucio . she, claudio, that you wronged, look you restore . joy to you, mariana ! love her, angelo . i have confessed her, and i know her virtue . thanks, good friend escalus, for thy much goodness; theres more behind that is more gratulate . thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy; we shall employ thee in a worthier place . forgive him, angelo, that brought you home the head of ragozine for claudios . th offence pardons itself . dear isabel, i have a motion much imports your good; whereto if youll a willing ear incline, whats mine is yours, and what is yours is mine . so, bring us to our palace, where well show whats yet behind thats meet you all should know . exeunt . <END>\n"

    "Use torchtext to add any word that has occurred at least three times in the dataset to the vocabulary because otherwise it would be too big.  Also add `unk` to handle missing vocab and `eos` to identify the end of sentence.\n",

    "This is a common and recommended practice in NLP. Limiting the vocabulary to words that appear at least a few times (e.g., 2 or 3) helps reduce memory usage and model complexity, while special tokens like unk and eos are standard for handling unknown words and marking sequence boundaries. This approach is widely used in language modeling and text processing."
